Or you might have been shipwrecked and on the brink of drowning when your patron’s grasp offered you a chance at life. Whatever the reason for your pact, the sea and its unknown depths call to you.\n\nEntities of the deep that might empower a warlock include krakens, ancient water elementals, godlike hallucinations dreamed into being by kuo-toa, merfolk demigods, and sea hag covens."},{"tags":"","hasCustomSpellList":false,"isStandard":false,"className":"Warlock","name":"The Genie","newFeatures":[{"name":"Genie’s Vessel","isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"isStandard":false,"source":{"book":"Tasha's Cauldron of Everything","page":73,"sourceType":"canon"},"level":1,"featureDescription":"Your patron gifts you a magical vessel that grants you a measure of the genie’s power. The vessel is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. You decide what the object is, or you can determine what it is randomly by rolling on the Genie’s Vessel table.\n\nWhile you are touching the vessel, you can use it in the following ways:\n\nBottled Respite. As an action, you can magically vanish and enter your vessel, which remains in the space you left. The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot-radius cylinder, 20 feet high, and resembles your vessel. The interior is appointed with cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature. While inside, you can hear the area around your vessel as if you were in its space. You can remain inside the vessel up to a number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You exit the vessel early if you use a bonus action to leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the vessel’s former space. Once you enter the vessel, you can’t enter again until you finish a long rest.\n\nGenie’s Wrath. Once during each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your proficiency bonus. The type of this damage is determined by your patron: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).\n\nThe vessel’s AC equals your spell save DC. Its hit points equal your warlock level plus your proficiency bonus, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.\n\nIf the vessel is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel is destroyed if it still exists. The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die.","tags":"","newEffects":{"selections":[{"level":1,"i1":1,"type":"simple","selectionGroup":{"type":"simple","items":[{"name":"Oil Lamp","type":"simple","content":"","isCustom":false},{"name":"Stoppered bottle","type":"simple","content":"","isCustom":false},{"name":"Ornate lantern","type":"simple","content":"","isCustom":false},{"name":"Urn","type":"simple","content":"","isCustom":false},{"name":"Hollow statuette","type":"simple","content":"","isCustom":false},{"name":"Ring with a compartment","type":"simple","content":"","isCustom":false}],"source":{"sourceType":"canon","book":"Tasha's Cauldron of Everything","page":74},"name":"Genie Vessel Options","additionalInformation":"","tags":""}}],"toggeable":false,"charges":[{"i1":1,"type":"","level":1,"d1":1,"i5":1}],"textboxInitialValue":"","textbox":false,"equations":[{"b3":true,"level":1,"s1":"Vessel Hitpoints","b5":true,"d3":1,"dice":[],"type":"","d1":1,"d5":1}]},"name":"Genie’s Vessel","type":"leveledFeature"}},{"customFeat":{"isStandard":false,"source":{"book":"Tasha's Cauldron of Everything","page":73,"sourceType":"canon"},"level":1,"featureDescription":"The Genie lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell.
