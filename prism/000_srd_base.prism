      "description": "A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you. Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.\n\n**Targeted Effects.** Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.\n\n**Areas of Magic.** The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\n\n**Spells.** Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\n\n**Magic Items.** The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\n\n**Magical Travel.** Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.\n\n**Creatures and Objects.** A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.\n\n**Dispel Magic.** Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other.",

For example, the ice created by a wall of ice is suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\n* **Creatures and Objects:** While within the sphere, any creatures or objects created or conjured by magic temporarily wink out of existence, reappearing immediately once the space they occupied is no longer within the sphere.\n* **Dispel Magic:** The sphere is immune to dispel magic and similar magical effects, including other antimagic field spells.\n* **Magic Items:** While within the sphere, magic items function as if they were mundane objects. Magic weapons and ammunition cease to be suppressed when they fully leave the sphere.\n* **Magical Travel:** Whether the sphere includes a destination or departure point, any planar travel or teleportation within it automatically fails. Until the spell ends or the sphere moves, magical portals and extradimensional spaces (such as that created by a bag of holding) within the sphere are closed.\n* **Spells:** Any spell cast within the sphere or at a target within the sphere is suppressed and the spell slot is consumed.

On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.

      "description": "You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn't need food or air and doesn't age. Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut-something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does-your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly. Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it. The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens. The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature's original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature's astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation. If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.",

The chariot has a speed of 50 feet and a flying speed of 40 feet.\n\nOn your turn, you can guide the chariot in place of your own movement. You can use a bonus action to direct it to take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action. As an action, you can use the chariot to overrun creatures in its path. On this turn, the chariot can enter a hostile creature’s space. The creature takes damage as if it had touched the chariot, is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that it can occupy, and must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall prone in that space.",

A creature can be the secondary target of blood strike only once every 24 hours; subsequent attempts during that time take full effect against the initial target with no chance to affect the secondary target. Only spells that have a single target can be transferred via blood stike.

You then touch a construct; it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or your allies are fighting the construct, it has advantage on the saving throw. Even constructs that are immune to charm effects can be affected by this spell.\n\nWhile the construct is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as, “Attack the ghouls,” “Block the bridge,” or, “Fetch that bucket.” If the construct completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends itself.\n\nYou can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the construct takes only the actions you specify and does nothing you haven’t ordered it to do. During this time, you can also cause the construct to use a reaction, but doing this requires you to use your own reaction as well.\n\nEach time the construct takes damage, it makes a new Constitution saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.\n\nIf the construct is already under your control when the spell is cast, it gains an Intelligence of 10 (unless its own Intelligence is higher, in which case it retains the higher score) for 4 hours. The construct is capable of acting independently, though it remains loyal to you for the spell’s duration. You can also grant the target a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier on one skill in which you have proficiency.\n\n\nAt Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 5th‑level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes.

The bolstered structures can be up to 20 feet tall and shaped as you desire. You can ward several small buildings in a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell. For the purpose of this spell, “structures” include walls, such as the palisade that might surround a small fort, provided the wall is no more than 20 feet tall.\n  For the duration, each structure you bolstered has a damage threshold of 5. If a structure already has a damage threshold, that threshold increases by 5.\n  This spell protects only the walls, support beams, roofs, and similar that make up the core components of the structure. It doesn't bolster objects within the structures, such as furniture.\n  The protected structure or structures radiate magic. A *dispel magic* cast on a structure removes the bolstering from only that structure. You can create a permanently bolstered structure or collection of structures by casting this spell there every day for one year.\n\nAt Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the square feet of floor space you can bolster increases by 500 and the damage threshold increases by 2 for each slot level above 3rd.",

Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends. Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.

The doorway must be at least 1 foot wide by 2 feet tall and can be no larger than 5 feet wide by 10 feet tall. Once the door is drawn, place the knob appropriately; it attaches magically to the surface and your drawing becomes a real door to the spell's destination. The doorway remains functional for the spell's duration. During that time, anyone can open or close the door and pass through it in either direction.\n  The destination can be on any plane of existence. It must be familiar to you, and your level of familiarity with it determines the accuracy of the spell (determined by the GM). If it's a place you've visited, you can expect 100 percent accuracy. If it's been described to you by someone who was there, you might arrive in the wrong room or even the wrong structure, depending on how detailed their description was. If you've only heard about the destination third-hand, you may end up in a similar structure that's in a very different locale.\n  *Door of the far traveler* doesn't create a doorway at the destination. It connects to an existing, working door. It can't, for example, take you to an open field or a forest with no structures (unless someone built a doorframe with a door in that spot for this specific purpose!). While the spell is in effect, the pre-existing doorway connects only to the area you occupied while casting the spell. If you connected to an existing doorway between a home's parlor and library, for example, and your door leads into the library, then people can still walk through that doorway from the parlor into the library normally. Anyone trying to go the other direction, however, arrives wherever you came from instead of in the parlor.\n  Before casting the spell, you must spend one hour etching magical symbols onto the doorknob that will serve as the spell's material component to attune it to your desired destination. Once prepared, the knob remains attuned to that destination until it's used or you spend another hour attuning it to a different location.\n  *The door of the far traveler* is dispelled if you remove the knob from the door. You can do this as a bonus action from either side of the door, provided it's shut. If the spell's duration expires naturally, the knob falls to the ground on whichever side of the door you're on. Once the spell ends, the knob loses its attunement to any location and another hour must be spent attuning it before it can be used again.\n\nAt Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a 9thlevel slot, the duration increases to 12 hours.",

Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal. When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature. Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.",

However, it is loyal to you and always obeys your commands.\n\nWhen the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it vanishes without a trace. Casting the spell again causes it to reappear.\n\nYou are able to communicate telepathically with your familiar when it is within 100 feet. As long as it is within this range, you can use an action to see through your familiar's eyes and hear through its ears until the beginning of your next turn, gaining the benefit of any special senses it has. During this time, you are blind and deaf to your body's surroundings.\n\nYou can use an action to either permanently dismiss your familiar or temporarily dismiss it to a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. While it is temporarily dismissed, you can use an action to call it back, causing it to appear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.\n\nYou can't have more than one familiar at a time, but if you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you can cause it to adopt a different form.\n\nFinally, when you cast a spell with a range of Touch and your familiar is within 100 feet of you, it can deliver the spell as if it was the spellcaster. Your familiar must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, use your attack bonus for the spell.",

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends. You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\n\n**Explosive Runes.** When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-­foot-­radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n**Spell Glyph.** You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\n\nAt Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.",

Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it. When an affected creature travels, it travels at a fast pace in the opposite direction of the direction you chose as it believes a pack of dogs or wolves follows it from the chosen direction.\n  When an affected creature isn't traveling, it is frightened of your chosen direction. The affected creature occasionally hears howls or sees glowing eyes in the darkness at the edge of its vision in that direction. An affected creature will not stop at a destination, instead pacing half-circles around the destination until the effect ends, terrified the pack will overcome it if it stops moving.\n  An affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each 4-hour period, ending the effect on itself on a success. An affected creature moves along the safest available route unless it has nowhere to move, such as if it arrives at the edge of a cliff. When an affected creature can't safely move in the opposite direction of your chosen direction, it cowers in place, defending itself from hostile creatures but otherwise taking no actions. In such circumstances, the affected creature can repeat the saving throw every minute, ending the effect on itself on a success. The spell's effect is suspended when an affected creature is engaged in combat, allowing it to move as necessary to face hostile creatures.\n\nAt Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases by 4 hours for each slot level above 5th. If an affected creature travels for more than 8 hours, it risks exhaustion as if on a forced march.",

Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it. The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.\n\n**Chaining.** Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then. The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.\n\n**Hedged Prison.** The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.\n\n**Minimus Containment.** The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\n\n**Slumber.** The target falls asleep and can't be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.\n\n**Ending the Spell.** During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points. A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.

      "description": "This ritual must be cast during a solar eclipse. It can target a person, an organization (including a city), or a kingdom. If targeting an organization or a kingdom, the incantation requires an object epitomizing the entity as part of the material component, such as a crown, mayoral seal, standard, or primary relic. If targeting a person, the primary performer must hold a vial of the person's blood. Over the course of the incantation, the components are mixed and the primary caster inscribes a false history and a sum of knowledge concerning the target into the book using the mockingbird quills. When the incantation is completed, whatever the caster wrote in the book becomes known and accepted as truth by the target. The target can attempt a Wisdom saving throw to negate this effect. If the target was a city or a kingdom, the saving throw is made with advantage by its current leader or ruler. If the saving throw fails, all citizens or members of the target organization or kingdom believe the account written in the book to be fact. Any information contrary to what was written in the book is forgotten within an hour, but individuals who make a sustained study of such information can attempt a Wisdom saving throw to retain the contradictory knowledge. Books containing contradictory information are considered obsolete or purposely misleading. Permanent structures such as statues of heroes who've been written out of existence are believed to be purely artistic endeavors or so old that no one remembers their identities anymore. The effects of this ritual can be reversed by washing the written words from the book using universal solvent and then burning the book to ashes in a magical fire. Incantation of lies made truth is intended to be a villainous motivator in a campaign, with the player characters fighting to uncover the truth and reverse the spell's effect. The GM should take care not to remove too much player agency with this ritual. The creatures affected should be predominantly NPCs, with PCs and even select NPCs able to resist it. Reversing the effect of the ritual can be the entire basis of a campaign.",

If you leave the snare as a trap, a creature must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to find the trap.\n  When a Large or smaller creature moves within 5 feet of the snare, the trap triggers. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically pulled into the air. The creature is restrained and hangs upside down 5 feet above the snare's location for 1 minute. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, escaping the snare on a success. Alternatively, a creature, including the restrained target, can use its action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained creature is freed, and the snare resets itself 1 minute later. If the creature succeeds on the check by 5 or more, the snare is destroyed instead.\n  This spell alerts you with a ping in your mind when the trap is triggered if you are within 1 mile of the snare. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.\n\nAt Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create one additional snare for each slot level above 3rd. When you receive the mental ping that a trap was triggered, you know which snare was triggered if you have more than one.",

This effectively paralyzes a creature that is made of metal or that is wearing metal armor with moving pieces; for example, scale mail would lock up because the scales must slide across each other, but a breastplate would be unaffected. Limited movement might still be possible, depending on how extensive the armor is, and speech is usually not affected. Metal constructs are paralyzed. An affected creature or construct can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A grease spell dispels lock armor on everything in its area.\n\n\nAt Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.",

On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again for 24 hours. Once you possess a creature's body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can't use any of its class features.

Your spell imbues the targets with an animating spirit, raising them as construct creatures similar in appearance to flesh golems, though with the strength and abilities of zombies. Dwarves use this to return the bodies of the fallen to clan tombs and to deny the corpses the foul attention of ghouls, necromancers, and similar foes. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command all the creatures you made with this spell if the creatures are within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the creatures will take and where they will move during the next day; you cannot command them to guard. If you issue no commands, the creatures only defend themselves against hostile creatures. Once given an order and direction of march, the creatures continue to follow it until they arrive at the destination you named or until 24 hours have elapsed when the spell ends and the corpses fall lifeless once more. To tell creatures to move for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creatures again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to 50 creatures you have animated with this spell rather than animating a new one.\n\nAt Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional construct creatures for each slot level above 3rd (two creatures/level at 4th, three creatures/level at 5th). Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse.",

You and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can move through the doorway into the realm beyond. For the spell's duration, the mirror remains anchored in the plane of origin, where it can't be broken or otherwise damaged by any mundane means. No creatures other than those you designate can pass through the mirror or see into the mirror realm.\n  The realm within the mirror is an exact reflection of the location you left. The temperature is comfortable, and any environmental threats (lava, poisonous gas, or similar) are inert, harmless facsimiles of the real thing. Likewise, magic items reflected in the mirror realm have no magical properties, but those carried into it work normally. Food, drink, and other beneficial items within the mirror realm (reflections of originals in the real world) function as normal, real items; food can be eaten, wine can be drunk, and so on. Only items that were reflected in the mirror at the moment the spell was cast exist inside the mirror realm. Items placed in front of the mirror afterward don't appear in the mirror realm, and creatures never do unless they are allowed in by you. Items found in the mirror realm dissolve into nothingness when they leave it, but the effects of food and drink remain.\n  Sound passes through the mirror in both directions. Creatures in the mirror realm can see what's happening in the world, but creatures in the world see only what the mirror reflects. Objects can cross the mirror boundary only while worn or carried by a creature, and spells can't cross it at all. You can't stand in the mirror realm and shoot arrows or cast spells at targets in the world or vice versa.\n  The boundaries of the mirror realm are the same as the room or location in the plane of origin, but the mirror realm can't exceed 50,000 square feet (for simplicity, imagine 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on a side). If the original space is larger than this, such as an open field or a forest, the boundary is demarcated with an impenetrable, gray fog.\n  Any creature still inside the mirror realm when the spell ends is expelled through the mirror into the nearest empty space.\n  If this spell is cast in the same spot every day for a year, it becomes permanent. Once permanent, the mirror can't be moved or destroyed through mundane means. You can allow new creatures into the mirror realm (and disallow previous creatures) by recasting the spell within range of the permanent mirror. Casting the spell elsewhere doesn't affect the creation or the existence of a permanent mirror realm; a determined spellcaster could have multiple permanent mirror realms to use as storage spaces, hiding spots, and spy vantages.",

      "description": "Deep Magic: clockwork You wind your music box and call forth a piece of another plane of existence with which you are familiar, either through personal experience or intense study. The magic creates a bubble of space with a 30-foot radius within range of you and at a spot you designate. The portion of your plane that's inside the bubble swaps places with a corresponding portion of the plane your music box is attuned with. There is a 10% chance that the portion of the plane you summon arrives with native creatures on it. Inanimate objects and non-ambulatory life (like trees) are cut off at the edge of the bubble, while living creatures that don't fit inside the bubble are shunted outside of it before the swap occurs. Otherwise, creatures from both planes that are caught inside the bubble are sent along with their chunk of reality to the other plane for the duration of the spell unless they make a successful Charisma saving throw when the spell is cast; with a successful save, a creature can choose whether to shift planes with the bubble or leap outside of it a moment before the shift occurs. Any natural reaction between the two planes occurs normally (fire spreads, water flows, etc.) while energy (such as necrotic energy) leaks slowly across the edge of the sphere (no more than a foot or two per hour). Otherwise, creatures and effects can move freely across the boundary of the sphere; for the duration of the spell, it becomes a part of its new location to the fullest extent possible, given the natures of the two planes. The two displaced bubbles shift back to their original places automatically after 24 hours. Note that the amount of preparation involved (acquiring and attuning the music box) precludes this spell from being cast on the spur of the moment. Because of its unpredictable and potentially wide-ranging effect, it's also advisable to discuss your interest in this spell with your GM before adding it to your character's repertoire.",

That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice). When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services. Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you. As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle. You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify.

If you don't issue it any commands, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The animated undergrowth creates difficult terrain for your enemies. Additionally, at the beginning of each of your turns, all creatures that are on the ground in range must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the spell ends. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature is restrained by plants at the beginning of your turn, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage. Finally, the trees swing at each enemy in range, requiring each creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. You can use a bonus action to recenter the spell on yourself. This does not grow additional trees in areas that previously had none.\n\nAt Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 9th-level slot, an additional tree becomes a treant, the undergrowth deals an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and the trees inflict an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage.",

Stepping through the portal places you on a shadow road leading to a destination within 50 miles, or in a direction specified by you. The road is in ideal condition. You and your companions can travel it safely at a normal pace, but you can't rest on the road; if you stop for more than 10 minutes, the spell expires and dumps you back into the real world at a random spot within 10 miles of your starting point. The spell expires 2d6 hours after being cast. When that happens, travelers on the road are safely deposited near their specified destination or 50 miles from their starting point in the direction that was specified when the spell was cast. Travelers never incur exhaustion no matter how many hours they spent walking or riding on the shadow road. The temporary shadow road ceases to exist; anything left behind is lost in the shadow realm. Each casting of risen road creates a new shadow road. A small chance exists that a temporary shadow road might intersect with an existing shadow road, opening the possibility for meeting other travelers or monsters, or for choosing a different destination mid-journey. The likelihood is entirely up to the GM.",

If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.

The sign affects creatures of the chosen type (including you, if applicable) in the following ways:\n* The creatures can’t willingly enter the cylinder’s area by nonmagical means; the cylinder acts as an invisible, impenetrable wall of force. If an affected creature tries to enter the cylinder’s area by using teleportation, a dimensional shortcut, or other magical means, it must make a successful Charisma saving throw or the attempt fails.\n* They cannot hear any sounds that originate inside the cylinder.\n* They have disadvantage on attack rolls against targets inside the cylinder.\n* They can’t charm, frighten, or possess creatures inside the cylinder.\nCreatures that aren’t affected by the field and that take a short rest inside it regain twice the usual number of hit points for each Hit Die spent at the end of the rest.\n\nWhen you cast this spell, you can choose to reverse its magic; doing this will prevent affected creatures from leaving the area instead of from entering it, make them unable to hear sounds that originate outside the cylinder, and so forth. In this case, the field provides no benefit for taking a short rest.\n\n\nAt Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the radius increases by 30 feet for each slot level above 7th.",

Any creature except you that enters the area or starts its turn there must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall prone and become incapacitated and unable to move. A creature that starts its turn prone and incapacitated makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage; on a successful save, it takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage, it’s no longer incapacitated, and it can move at half speed.\n\nAll ranged weapon attacks inside the area have a normal range of 5 feet and a maximum range of 10 feet.

A creature under the influence of a [freedom of movement](https://api.open5e.com/spells/freedom-of-movement) spell or comparable magic has advantage on the Strength saving throws required by this spell, and its speed isn’t reduced once it recovers from being incapacitated.",

It understands and obeys verbal commands you give it. If you do not give the star a command, it defends itself and attacks the last creature that attacked it. The star disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.",

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph. You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\n\n**Death.** Each target must make a constitution saving throw, taking 10d 10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save\n\n **Discord.** Each target must make a constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\n\n**Fear.** Each target must make a wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\n\n**Hopelessness.** Each target must make a charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can't attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.\n\n**Insanity.** Each target must make an intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement, which is erratic.\n\n**Pain.** Each target must make a constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.\n\n**Sleep.** Each target must make a wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.\n\n**Stunning.** Each target must make a wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.",

      "description": "This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults the table.\n\n**Familiarity.** \"Permanent circle\" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. \"Associated object\" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb. \"Very familiar\" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \"Seen casually\" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. \"Viewed once\" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. \"Description\" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map. \"False destination\" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.\n\n**On Target.** You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.\n\n**Off Target.** You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\n\n**Similar Area.** You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\n\n**Mishap.** The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).",

You must know the location you're teleporting to, and it must be on the same plane of existence.\n\nTeleportation is difficult magic and you may arrive off-target or somewhere else entirely depending on how familiar you are with the location you're teleporting to. When you teleport, the Narrator rolls 1d100 and consults Table: Teleport Familiarity.\n\nFamiliarity is determined as follows: Permanent Circle: A permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know (see teleportation circle).\n\nAssociated Object: You have an object taken from the target location within the last 6 months, such as a piece of wood from the pew in a grand temple or a pinch of grave dust from a vampire's hidden redoubt.\n\nVery Familiar: A place you have frequented, carefully studied, or can see at the time you cast the spell.\n\nSeen Casually: A place you have seen more than once but don't know well. This could be a castle you've passed by but never visited, or the farms you look down on from your tower of ivory.\n\nViewed Once: A place you have seen once, either in person or via magic.\n\nDescription: A place you only know from someone else's description (whether spoken, written, or even marked on a map).\n\nFalse Destination: A place that doesn't actually exist. This typically happens when someone deceives you, either intentionally (like a wizard creating an illusion to hide their actual tower) or unintentionally (such as when the location you attempt to teleport to no longer exists).\n\nYour arrival is determined as follows: On Target: You and your targets arrive exactly where you mean to.\n\nOff Target: You and your targets arrive some distance away from the target in a random direction. The further you travel, the further away you are likely to arrive. You arrive off target by a number of miles equal to 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the total distance of your trip.\n\nIf you tried to travel 1, 000 miles and roll a 2 and 4 on the d10s, you land 6 percent off target and arrive 60 miles away from your intended destination in a random direction. Roll 1d8 to randomly determine the direction: 1—north, 2 —northeast, 3 —east, 4 —southeast, 5—south, 6 —southwest, 7—west, 8—northwest.\n\nSimilar Location: You and your targets arrive in a different location that somehow resembles the target area. If you tried to teleport to your favorite inn, you might end up at a different inn, or in a room with much of the same decor.\n\nTypically you appear at the closest similar location, but that is not always the case.\n\nMishap: The spell's magic goes awry, and each teleporting creature or object takes 3d10 force damage.

A creature burrowing through the area has its speed halved until the area thaws, unless it can burrow through solid rock. A creature of elemental earth within range must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 cold damage.\n* ***Fire.*** Flames or other sources of extreme heat (such as molten lava) on the ground within range transform into shards of ice, and the area they occupy becomes difficult terrain.

A creature of elemental fire within range must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 cold damage and be stunned for 1d6 rounds.\n* ***Water.*** Open water (a pond, lake, or river) freezes to a depth of 4 feet. A creature on the surface of the water when it freezes must make a successful Dexterity saving throw to avoid being trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can free itself by using an action to make a successful Strength (Athletics) check.

Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall. The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp. If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on. The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion. If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.",

The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice: \n- You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. \n- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell. \n- You grant up to ten creatures you can see resistance to a damage type you choose. \n- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack. \n- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. \nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.",

      "description": "### Rage \n \nIn battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. \n \nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor: \n \n* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. \n* When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table. \n* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. \n \nIf you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging. \n \nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. \n \nOnce you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. \n \n### Unarmored Defense \n \nWhile you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. \n \n### Reckless Attack \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn. \n \n### Danger Sense \n \nAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. \n \nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated. \n \n### Primal Path \n \nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Fast Movement \n \nStarting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor. \n \n### Feral Instinct \n \nBy 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. \n \nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn. \n \n### Brutal Critical \n \nBeginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. \n \nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level. \n \n### Relentless Rage \n \nStarting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. \n \nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10. \n \n### Persistent Rage \n \nBeginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it. \n \n### Indomitable Might \n \nBeginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total. \n \n### Primal Champion \n \nAt 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.",

      "description": "### Spellcasting \n \nYou have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. \n \nYour spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table. \n \n#### Spell Slots \n \nThe Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *cure wounds* using either slot. \n \n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher \n \nYou know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list. \n \nThe Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. \n \nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n#### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a musical instrument (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. \n \n### Bardic Inspiration \n \nYou can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. \n \nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. \n \nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. \n \nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level. \n \n### Jack of All Trades \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus. \n \n### Song of Rest \n \nBeginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points. \n \nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level. \n \n### Bard College \n \nAt 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of \n \nthe class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level. \n \n### Expertise \n \nAt 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. \n \nAt 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Font of Inspiration \n \nBeginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest. \n \n### Countercharm \n \nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required). \n \n### Magical Secrets \n \nBy 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. \n \nThe chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table. \n \nYou learn two additional spells from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level. \n \n### Superior Inspiration \n \nAt 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.",

      "description": "### Spellcasting \n \nAs a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table. \n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four \n1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n#### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. \n \n### Divine Domain \n \nChoose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. \n \n#### Domain Spells \n \nEach domain has a list of spells-its domain spells- that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. \n \nIf you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. \n \n### Channel Divinity \n \nAt 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. \n \nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. \n \nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. \n \nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel \n \nDivinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. \n \n#### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead \n \nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. \n \nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Destroy Undead \n \nStarting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table. \n \n**Destroy Undead (table)** \n \n| Cleric Level | Destroys Undead of CR... | \n|--------------|--------------------------| \n| 5th          | 1/2 or lower             | \n| 8th          | 1 or lower               | \n| 11th         | 2 or lower               | \n| 14th         | 3 or lower               | \n| 17th         | 4 or lower               | \n \n### Divine Intervention \n \nBeginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. \n \nImploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. \n \nIf your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest. \n \nAt 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.",

You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic. \n \n### Spellcasting \n \nDrawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nAt 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. \n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n### Spellcasting Ability \n \nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a druidic focus (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. \n \n### Wild Shape \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. \n \nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed. \n \n**Beast Shapes (table)** \n \n| Level | Max. CR | Limitations                 | Example     | \n|-------|---------|-----------------------------|-------------| \n| 2nd   | 1/4     | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf        | \n| 4th   | 1/2     | No flying speed             | Crocodile   | \n| 8th   | 1       | -                           | Giant eagle | \n \nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. \n \nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply: \n \n* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them. \n* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious. \n* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you've already cast. \n* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. \n* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. \n \n### Druid Circle \n \nAt 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Timeless Body \n \nStarting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. \n \n### Beast Spells \n \nBeginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components. \n \n### Archdruid \n \nAt 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. \n \nAdditionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.",

You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. \n \n#### Archery \n \nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. \n \n#### Defense \n \nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. \n \n#### Dueling \n \nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. \n \n#### Great Weapon Fighting \n \nWhen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. \n \n#### Protection \n \nWhen a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. \n \n#### Two-Weapon Fighting \n \nWhen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. \n \n### Second Wind \n \nYou have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. \n \n### Action Surge \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action. \n \nOnce you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn. \n \n### Martial Archetype \n \nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose Champion, Battle Master, or Eldritch Knight, all detailed at the end of the class description.

As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \nThe number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class. \n \n### Indomitable \n \nBeginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. \n \nYou can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.\n \n### Martial Archetypes \n \nDifferent fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.",

      "description": "### Unarmored Defense \n \nBeginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. \n \n### Martial Arts \n \nAt 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two- handed or heavy property. \n \nYou gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield: \n \n* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. \n* You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. \n* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. \n \nCertain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon. \n \n### Ki \n \nStarting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. \n \nYou can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. \n \nWhen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. \n \nSome of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \n \n**Ki save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n#### Flurry of Blows \n \nImmediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action. \n \n#### Patient Defense \n \nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. \n \n#### Step of the Wind \n \nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn. \n \n### Unarmored Movement \n \nStarting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. \n \nAt 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. \n \n### Monastic Tradition \n \nWhen you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. \n \n### Deflect Missiles \n \nStarting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. \n \nIf you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Slow Fall \n \nBeginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Stunning Strike \n \nStarting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. \n \n### Ki-Empowered Strikes \n \nStarting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. \n \n### Evasion \n \nAt 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a *fireball* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. \n \n### Stillness of Mind \n \nStarting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened. \n \n### Purity of Body \n \nAt 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison. \n \n### Tongue of the Sun and Moon \n \nStarting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say. \n \n### Diamond Soul \n \nBeginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws. \n \nAdditionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result. \n \n### Timeless Body \n \nAt 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water. \n \n### Empty Body \n \nBeginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage. \n \nAdditionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the *astral projection* spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you. \n \n### Perfect Self \n \nAt 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points. \n \n### Monastic Traditions \n \nThree traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.",

      "description": "### Divine Sense \n \nThe presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire \n \nCount Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the *hallow* spell. \n \nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses. \n \n### Lay on Hands \n \nYour blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5. \n \nAs an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. \n \nAlternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one. \n \nThis feature has no effect on undead and constructs. \n \n### Fighting Style \n \nAt 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. \n \n#### Defense \n \nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. \n \n#### Dueling \n \nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. \n \n#### Great Weapon Fighting \n \nWhen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. \n \n#### Protection \n \nWhen a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. \n \n### Spellcasting \n \nBy 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. \n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd- level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells. \n \n### Divine Smite \n \nStarting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend. \n \n### Divine Health \n \nBy 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.\n\n ### Sacred Oath \n\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description. \n \nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature. \n \n#### Oath Spells \n \nEach oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. \n \nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you. \n \n#### Channel Divinity \n \nYour oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it. \n \nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. \n \nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.\n\n>### Breaking Your Oath \n>\n> A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath. \n> \n> A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all- night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh. \n> \n> If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.\n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Aura of Protection \n \nStarting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus. \n \nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. \n \n### Aura of Courage \n \nStarting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious. \n \nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. \n \n### Improved Divine Smite \n \nBy 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite. \n \n### Cleansing Touch \n \nBeginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. \n \nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. \n \n### Sacred Oaths \n \nBecoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.",

      "description": "### Favored Enemy \n \nBeginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy. \n \nChoose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies. \n \nYou have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. \n \nWhen you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all. \n \nYou choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures. \n \n### Natural Explorer \n \nYou are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in. \n \nWhile traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits: \n* Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel. \n* Your group can't become lost except by magical means. \n* Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. \n* If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. \n* When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would. \n* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area. \n \nYou choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level. \n \n### Fighting Style \n \nAt 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. \n \n#### Archery \n \nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. \n \n#### Defense \n \nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. \n \n#### Dueling \n \nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. \n \n#### Two-Weapon Fighting \n \nWhen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. \n \n### Spellcasting \n \nBy the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list. \n \n#### Spell Slots \n \nThe Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell *animal friendship* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *animal friendship* using either slot. \n \n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher \n \nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list. \n \nThe Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. \n \nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n### Ranger Archetype \n \nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level. \n \n### Primeval Awareness \n \nBeginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Land's Stride \n \nStarting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. \n \nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* spell. \n \n### Hide in Plain Sight \n \nStarting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage. \n \nOnce you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit. \n \n### Vanish \n \nStarting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail. \n \n### Feral Senses \n \nAt 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. \n \nYou are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened. \n \n### Foe Slayer \n \nAt 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.",

      "description": "### Expertise \n \nAt 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. \n \nAt 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit. \n \n### Sneak Attack \n \nBeginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. \n \nYou don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. \n \nThe amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. \n \n### Thieves' Cant \n \nDuring your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. \n \nIn addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run. \n \n### Cunning Action \n \nStarting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. \n \n### Roguish Archetype \n \nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Uncanny Dodge \n \nStarting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you. \n \n### Evasion \n \nBeginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an *ice storm* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. \n \n### Reliable Talent \n \nBy 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. \n \n### Blindsense \n \nStarting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you. \n \n### Slippery Mind \n \nBy 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. \n \n### Elusive \n \nBeginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated. \n \n### Stroke of Luck \n \nAt 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. \n \nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. \n \n### Roguish Archetypes \n \nRogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus-not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.",

      "description": "### Spellcasting \n \nAn event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nAt 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table. \n \n#### Spell Slots \n \nThe Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell *burning hands* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *burning hands* using either slot. \n \n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher \n \nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. \n \nThe Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. \n \nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells. \n \n### Sorcerous Origin \n \nChoose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the class description. \n \nYour choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level. \n \n### Font of Magic \n \nAt 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects. \n \n#### Sorcery Points \n \nYou have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Flexible Casting \n \nYou can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels. \n \n**_Creating Spell Slots._** You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th. \n \nAny spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest. \n \n**Creating Spell Slots (table)** \n \n| Spell Slot Level | Sorcery Point Cost | \n|------------------|--------------------| \n| 1st              | 2                  | \n| 2nd              | 3                  | \n| 3rd              | 5                  | \n| 4th              | 6                  | \n| 5th              | 7                  | \n \n**_Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points._** As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level. \n \n### Metamagic \n \nAt 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level. \n \nYou can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted. \n \n#### Careful Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell. \n \n#### Distant Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell. \n \nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet. \n \n#### Empowered Spell \n \nWhen you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. \n \nYou can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. \n \n#### Extended Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours. \n \n#### Heightened Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell. \n \n#### Quickened Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting. \n \n#### Subtle Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components. \n \n#### Twinned Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip). \n \nTo be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, *magic missile* and *scorching ray* aren't eligible, but *ray of frost* and *chromatic orb* are. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Sorcerous Restoration \n \nAt 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest. \n \n### Sorcerous Origins \n \nDifferent sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic.",

      "description": "### Otherworldly Patron \n \nAt 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. \n \n### Pact Magic \n \nYour arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table. \n \n#### Spell Slots \n \nThe Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. \n \nFor example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell *thunderwave*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. \n \n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher \n \nAt 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. \n \nThe Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. \n \nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. \n \n### Eldritch Invocations \n \nIn your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. \n \nAt 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. \n \nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. \n \n### Pact Boon \n \nAt 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice. \n \n#### Pact of the Chain \n \nYou learn the *find familiar* spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known. \n \nWhen you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite. \n \nAdditionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction. \n \n#### Pact of the Blade \n \nYou can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. \n \nYour pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. \n \nYou can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. \n \n#### Pact of the Tome \n \nYour patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. \n \nIf you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.\n\n\n \n> ### Your Pact Boon \n> \n> Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron's nature. \n> \n> **_Pact of the Chain._** Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One's nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it. \n> \n> **_Pact of the Blade._** If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye. \n> \n> **_Pact of the Tome._** Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Mystic Arcanum \n \nAt 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th- level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum. \n \nYou can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. \n \nAt higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th- level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest. \n \n### Eldritch Master \n \nAt 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. \n \n### Eldritch Invocations \n \nIf an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class. \n \n#### Agonizing Blast \n \n*Prerequisite:* eldritch blast *cantrip* \n \nWhen you cast *eldritch blast*, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit. \n \n#### Armor of Shadows \n \nYou can cast *mage armor* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n \n#### Ascendant Step \n \n*Prerequisite: 9th level* \n \nYou can cast *levitate* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n \n#### Beast Speech \n \nYou can cast *speak with animals* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Beguiling Influence \n \nYou gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills. \n \n#### Bewitching Whispers \n \n*Prerequisite: 7th level* \n \nYou can cast *compulsion* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Book of Ancient Secrets \n \n*Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature* \n \nYou can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag. \n \nOn your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it. \n \n#### Chains of Carceri \n \n*Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature* \n \nYou can cast *hold monster* at will-targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental-without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again. \n \n#### Devil's Sight \n \nYou can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet. \n \n#### Dreadful Word \n \n*Prerequisite: 7th level* \n \nYou can cast *confusion* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Eldritch Sight \n \nYou can cast *detect magic* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Eldritch Spear \n \n*Prerequisite:* eldritch blast *cantrip* \n \nWhen you cast *eldritch blast*, its range is 300 feet. \n \n#### Eyes of the Rune Keeper \n \nYou can read all writing. \n \n#### Fiendish Vigor \n \nYou can cast *false life* on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n \n#### Gaze of Two Minds \n \nYou can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings. \n \n#### Lifedrinker \n \n*Prerequisite: 12th level, Pact of the Blade feature* \n \nWhen you hit a creature with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). \n \n#### Mask of Many Faces \n \nYou can cast *disguise self* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Master of Myriad Forms \n \n*Prerequisite: 15th level* \n \nYou can cast *alter self* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Minions of Chaos \n \n*Prerequisite: 9th level* \n \nYou can cast *conjure elemental* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Mire the Mind \n \n*Prerequisite: 5th level* \n \nYou can cast *slow* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Misty Visions \n \nYou can cast *silent image* at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n \n#### One with Shadows \n \n*Prerequisite: 5th level* \n \nWhen you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible until you move or take an action or a reaction. \n \n#### Otherworldly Leap \n \n*Prerequisite: 9th level* \n \nYou can cast *jump* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n \n#### Repelling Blast \n \n*Prerequisite:* eldritch blast *cantrip* \n \nWhen you hit a creature with *eldritch blast*, you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line. \n \n#### Sculptor of Flesh \n \n*Prerequisite: 7th level* \n \nYou can cast *polymorph* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Sign of Ill Omen \n \n*Prerequisite: 5th level* \n \nYou can cast *bestow curse* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Thief of Five Fates \n \nYou can cast *bane* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Thirsting Blade \n \n*Prerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Blade feature* \n \nYou can attack with your pact weapon twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n#### Visions of Distant Realms \n \n*Prerequisite: 15th level* \n \nYou can cast *arcane eye* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Voice of the Chain Master \n \n*Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature* \n \nYou can communicate telepathically with your familiar and perceive through your familiar's senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence. Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar's senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech. \n \n#### Whispers of the Grave \n \n*Prerequisite: 9th level* \n \nYou can cast *speak with dead* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Witch Sight \n \n*Prerequisite: 15th level* \n \nYou can see the true form of any shapechanger or creature concealed by illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet of you and within line of sight. \n \n### Otherworldly Patrons \n \nThe beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence-not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return. \n \nSome patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.",

      "description": "### Spellcasting \n \nAs a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. \n \n#### Spellbook \n \nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st- level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\n \n> ### Your Spellbook \n> \n> The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. \n> \n> **_Copying a Spell into the Book._** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. \n> \n> Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. \n> \n> For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. \n> \n> **_Replacing the Book._** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. \n> \n> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. \n> \n> **_The Book's Appearance._** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.\n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *magic missile,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier \n \n#### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. \n \n#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher \n \nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).\n \n### Arcane Recovery \n \nYou have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. \n \nFor example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. \n \n### Arcane Tradition \n \nWhen you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description. \n \nYour choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Spell Mastery \n \nAt 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. \n \nBy spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels. \n \n### Signature Spells \n \nWhen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. \n \nIf you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. \n \n### Arcane Traditions \n \nThe study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study. \n \nThe most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.",
