Each changeling can supernaturally adopt any face they like. For some changelings, a new face is only a disguise. For other changelings, a new face may reveal an aspect of their soul.\n\nThe first changelings in the multiverse appeared in the Feywild, and the wondrous, mutable essence of that plane lingers in changelings today—even in those changelings who have never set foot in the fey realm. Each changeling decides how to use their shape-shifting ability, channeling either the peril or the joy of the Feywild. Sometimes they adopt new forms for the sake of mischief or malice, and other times they don a new identity to right wrongs or delight the downtrodden.\n\nIn their true form, changelings appear faded, their features almost devoid of detail. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shape—one created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history—is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth, crafting whole personas complete with histories and beliefs. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.\n\nPersonas can be shared by multiple changelings; a community might be home to three healer changelings, with whoever is on duty adopting the persona of Andrea, the gentle physician. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona’s previous users.","heightFeet":-32768,"femaleNames":"","maleNames":"","higherAge":0,"isNoGenderName":true,"sizes":["Small","Medium"],"source":{"sourceType":"canon","book":"Monsters of the Multiverse"},"numSkillSelections":0,"newFeatures":[{"isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"featureDescription":"Thanks to your connection to the fey realm, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion.","source":{"book":"Eberron : Rising from the Last War","sourceType":"canon","page":17},"newEffects":{"textbox":false,"skills":[{"skills":{"skills":{"performance":true,"insight":true,"persuasion":true,"intimidation":true,"deception":true}},"i1":2,"type":"select","level":0,"i3":1}],"toggeable":false,"textboxInitialValue":""},"isStandard":false,"level":0,"tags":"","type":"noLevelFeature","name":"Changeling Instincts"},"name":"Changeling Instincts"},{"isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"featureDescription":"As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice.

The powerful genies, however, don’t face such troubles when venturing into the mortal world. They adapt well to the mingled elements of the Material Plane, and they sometimes visit—whether of their own volition or compelled by magic. Some genies can adopt mortal guise and travel incognito.\n\nDuring these visits, a mortal might catch a genie’s eye. Friendship forms, romance blooms, and sometimes children result. These children are genasi: individuals with ties to two worlds, yet belonging to neither. Some genasi are born of mortal–genie unions, others have two genasi as parents, and a rare few have a genie further up their family tree, manifesting an elemental heritage that’s lain dormant for generations.\n\nOccasionally, genasi result from exposure to a surge of elemental power, through phenomena such as an eruption from the Inner Planes or a planar convergence.

He grips the weightless sigil, twisting it to unleash streams of dark energy that curse the blood of the monster’s own veins to even the odds.\n\nA mysterious half-elf swathed in a worn cloak and rugged leather armor carefully investigates the site of a roadway massacre, her eyes flashing with recognition as she meditates on the remnants of the grisly scene. Suddenly, she jumps to her feet, certain in the knowledge of what creature was responsible, where it can be found—and how little time she has before it kills again.\n\nStepping into lightless chambers filled with ancient dust and lingering whispers, the halfling picks up the warning of imminent danger from the scraping of bone and claw on nearby stone. She winces as she runs her blade across her palm, the steel transmuting blood and essence into glowing runes of powerful magic, eager to brand and burn the flesh of her enemies.\n\nBlood hunters are clever warriors driven by an unending determination to destroy evils old and new. Armed with rites of secretive blood magic and a willingness to sacrifice their own vitality and humanity for their cause, they protect the realms from the shadows—even as they remain ever vigilant against being drawn to the darkness that consumes the monsters they hunt.\n\nSacrifice to Preserve Life\nFar from the judging eyes of society, blood hunters have mastered the secretive techniques of hemocraft, finding blood magic’s esoteric nature effective against evils that resist divine rebuke or arcane bindings. Through careful study and practice, blood hunters hone the rites of hemocraft into unique combat techniques, forfeiting a portion of their own health to call blood curses down upon their enemies or summon the elements to aid their strikes. Willing to suffer whatever it takes to achieve victory, these adept warriors have forged themselves into a potent force dedicated to protecting the innocent.\n\nA Monster to Fight Monsters\nWhether driven by the wish to make a difference, the need to take vengeance, or the hope of finding a place to belong in an uncaring world, every blood hunter has their own reasons for undertaking the ritual of the Hunter’s Bane that starts them on this path. In joining an order of blood hunters, one also joins a family bound by service to each other and a common cause. For many, this might be the only family they have left—or have ever known—making the kinship felt between blood hunters an all-but-unbreakable bond.\n\nOutside the camaraderie of their orders, however, the life of a blood hunter is not an easy one. The ritual of the Hunter’s Bane can leave a character visibly changed, and prone to unsettling the people around them. Likewise, witnessing hemocraft can invoke superstitious fears from even the most learned scholars. While some cultures have come to accept the good deeds of many blood hunter orders, many blood hunters hide their calling unless absolutely necessary. They feel more comfortable in the wilds and wastes of the world, or drift through the outskirts of society, protecting the poor and defenseless from dark intention and the corrupting touch of fiends.\n\nIn choosing this path, every blood hunter irrevocably gives a part of themself to their cause—physically, emotionally, and sometimes morally. Each order of blood hunters practices its own ideals and methods, often employing techniques with dark origins that test the strength and will of those who employ them. Many wrestle with the fear of losing this struggle. And so a life of discipline and vigilance drives a blood hunter’s travels as they wander the countryside, in search of like-minded adventurers and whispers of dark deeds afoot.","selectionSkills":{"insight":true,"athletics":true,"investigation":true,"history":true,"arcana":true,"acrobatics":true,"survival":true,"religion":true},"startingGold":0,"primaryStats":{"strength":true,"dexterity":true},"hitDice":10,"startingEquipment":"(1) Martial Weapon(s) or (2) Simple Weapon(s)##(1) Crossbow Bolts and (1) Light Crossbow or (1) Crossbow Bolts and (1) Hand Crossbow##(1) Scale Mail or (1) Studded Leather##(1) Explorers Pack","name":"Blood Hunter","customSpellCasterClasses":[],"iconIndex":12,"armorProficiencies":{"heavy":false,"light":true,"medium":true,"shield":true}}],"spells":[],"languages":[{"additionalInformation":"","isStandard":false,"name":"Grung","tags":"Added#####Type: Language","source":{"sourceType":"canon","book":"One Grung Above","page":4}}],"feats":[],"subclasses":[{"name":"Aberrant Mind","className":"Sorcerer","isStandard":false,"subclassDescription":"An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot.\n\nSpells Known of 1st-Level and Higher\n\nYou know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the wizard spell list.\n\nThe Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\n\nThe spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.\n\nWhenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.","newEffects":{"textbox":false,"spells":[{"level":3,"i1":1,"type":"select","casters":[],"b1":true,"spells":[{"isCustom":false,"type":"spell","name":"Mage Hand"}]}],"textboxInitialValue":"","toggeable":false},"level":3,"source":{"book":"Player's Handbook","sourceType":"canon"},"tags":"Added#####Class: Rogue"}},{"name":"Magical Ambush","isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"name":"Magical Ambush","type":"leveledFeature","isStandard":false,"featureDescription":"Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell this turn.","newEffects":{"textbox":false,"textboxInitialValue":"","toggeable":false},"level":9,"source":{"sourceType":"canon","book":"Player's Handbook"},"tags":"Added#####Class: Rogue"}},{"isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"name":"Versatile Trickster","type":"leveledFeature","isStandard":false,"featureDescription":"At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with your mage hand.

As an action, you can magically vanish and enter your vessel, which remains in the space you left. The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot-radius cylinder, 20 feet high, and resembles your vessel.

You can remain inside the vessel up to a number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You exit the vessel early if you use a bonus action to leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the vessel’s former space. Once you enter the vessel, you can’t enter again until you finish a long rest.\n\nGenie’s Wrath. Once during each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your proficiency bonus. The type of this damage is determined by your patron: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).\n\nThe vessel’s AC equals your spell save DC. Its hit points equal your warlock level plus your proficiency bonus, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.\n\nIf the vessel is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel is destroyed if it still exists. The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die.","newEffects":{"toggeable":false,"equations":[{"d1":1,"d3":1,"level":1,"s1":"Vessel Hitpoints","d5":1,"type":"","b5":true,"dice":[],"b3":true}],"selections":[{"selectionGroup":{"type":"simple","additionalInformation":"","tags":"","source":{"book":"Tasha's Cauldron of Everything","page":74,"sourceType":"canon"},"items":[{"name":"Urn","isCustom":false,"type":"simple","content":""},{"name":"Hollow statuette","isCustom":false,"type":"simple","content":""},{"name":"Oil Lamp","isCustom":false,"type":"simple","content":""},{"name":"Stoppered bottle","isCustom":false,"type":"simple","content":""},{"name":"Ornate lantern","isCustom":false,"type":"simple","content":""},{"name":"Ring with a compartment","isCustom":false,"type":"simple","content":""}],"name":"Genie Vessel Options"},"type":"simple","i1":1,"level":1}],"textboxInitialValue":"","textbox":false,"charges":[{"d1":1,"i5":1,"type":"","i1":1,"level":1}]}}},{"isCustom":true,"name":"The Genie Expanded Spell List","customFeat":{"level":1,"isStandard":false,"type":"leveledFeature","source":{"page":73,"book":"Tasha's Cauldron of Everything","sourceType":"canon"},"tags":"","name":"The Genie Expanded Spell List","featureDescription":"The Genie lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell.
