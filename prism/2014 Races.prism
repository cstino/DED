Many aarakocra aren’t even native to the Material Plane. They hail from a world beyond — from the boundless vistas of the Elemental Plane of Air.\n\nThey are immigrants, refugees, scouts, and explorers, their outposts functioning as footholds in a world both strange and alien.\n\nBeak and Feather\n\nFrom below, aarakocra look much like large birds. Only when they descend to roost on a branch or walk across the ground does their humanoid appearance reveal itself. Standing upright, aarakocra might reach 5 feet tall, and they have long, narrow legs that taper to sharp talons.\n\nFeathers cover their bodies. Their plumage typically denotes membership in a tribe. Males are brightly colored, with feathers of red, orange, or yellow. Females have more subdued colors, usually brown or gray. Their heads complete the avian appearance, being something like a parrot or eagle with distinct tribal variations.\n\nSky Wardens\n\nNowhere are the aarakocra more comfortable than in the sky. They can spend hours in the air, and some go as long as days, locking their wings in place and letting the thermals hold them aloft. In battle, they prove dynamic and acrobatic fliers, moving with remarkable speed and grace, diving to lash opponents with weapons or talons before turning and flying away.\n\nOnce airborne, an aarakocra leaves the sky with reluctance. On their native plane, they can fly for days or months, landing only to lay their eggs and feed their young before launching themselves back into the air. Those that make it to a world in the Material Plane find it a strange place. They sometimes forget or ignore vertical distances, and they have nothing but pity for those earthbound people forced to live and toil on the ground.\n\nAvian Mannerisms\n\nThe resemblance of aarakocra to birds isn’t limited to physical features. Aarakocra display many of the same mannerisms as ordinary birds. They are fastidious about their plumage, frequently tending their feathers, cleaning and scratching away any tiny passengers they might have picked up. When they deign to descend from the sky, they often do so near pools where they can catch fish and bathe themselves.\n\nMany aarakocra punctuate their speech with chirps, sounds they use to convey emphasis and to shade meaning, much as a human might through facial expressions and gestures. An aarakocra might become frustrated with people who fail to pick up on the nuances; an aarakocra’s threat might be taken as a jest and vice versa.\n\nThe idea of ownership baffles most aarakocra. After all, who owns the sky? Even when explained to them, they initially find the notion of ownership mystifying. As a result, aarakocra who have little interaction with other people might be a nuisance as they drop from the sky to snatch livestock or plunder harvests for fruits and grains. Shiny, glittering objects catch their eyes.\n\nThey find it hard not to pluck the treasure and bring it back to their settlement to beautify it. An aarakocra who spends years among other races can learn to inhibit these impulses.\n\nConfinement terrifies the aarakocra. To be grounded, trapped underground, or imprisoned by the cold, unyielding earth is a torment few aarakocra can withstand. Even when perched on a high branch or at rest in their mountaintop homes, they appear alert, with eyes moving and bodies ready to take flight.\n\nHomelands\n\nMost aarakocra live on the Elemental Plane of Air. Aarakocra can be drawn into the Material Plane, sometimes to pursue enemies or thwart their foes’ designs there. Accident might also send a nest of aarakocra tumbling into a world on that plane. A few find their way to such a world through portals on their own plane and establish nests in high mountains or in the canopies of old forests.\n\nOnce tribes of aarakocra settle in an area, they share a hunting territory that extends across an area up to 100 miles on a side, with each tribe hunting in the lands nearest to their colony, ranging farther should game become scarce.\n\nA typical colony consists of one large, open-roofed nest made of woven vines. The eldest acts as leader with the support of a shaman\n\nGreat Purpose\n\nAarakocra enjoy peace and solitude. Most of them have little interest in dealing with other peoples and less interest in spending time on the ground. For this reason, it takes an exceptional circumstance for an aarakocra to leave his or her tribe and undertake the adventurer’s life. Neither treasure nor glory is enough to lure them from their tribes; a dire threat to their people, a mission of vengeance, or a catastrophe typically lies at the heart of the aarakocra adventurer’s chosen path.\n\nTwo other circumstances might call an aarakocra to adventure. First, aarakocra have historical ties to the Wind Dukes of Aaqa. Exceptional individuals honor that connection and might seek out the missing pieces of the Rod of Seven Parts, the remains of an artifact fashioned by the Wind Dukes long ago to defeat the Queen of Chaos’s monstrous champion, Miska the Wolf-Spider.\n\nWhen plunged into Miska’s body, the chaos in his blood sundered the rod and scattered its pieces across the multiverse. Recovering the pieces means gaining honor and esteem in the eyes of the vaati who forged it and could possibly restore a powerful weapon for defense against the agents of elemental evil.\n\nSecond, aarakocra are sworn foes of elemental earth, in particular the gargoyles that serve Ogrémoch, the Prince of Earth. The Aarakocra word for gargoyle is loosely translated as “flying rock,” and battles between aarakocra and gargoyles have raged across the Elemental Planes of Earth and Air, occasionally spilling into a world on the Material Plane. Aarakocra on that plane might leave their colonies to lend aid to other humanoids committed to fighting earth cults and thwarting their efforts.","freePoints":[0,2,0,0,1,0],"isStandard":false,"maleNames":"","heightInches":1,"selectionSkills":{},"noGenderNames":"Aera#####Aial#####Aur#####Deekek#####Errk#####Heehk#####Ikki#####Kleeck#####Oorr#####Ouss#####Quaf#####Quierk#####Salleek#####Urreek#####or Zeed.","colorIndex":6,"higherAge":30},{"name":"Aasimar","heightFeet":4,"tags":"Added#####Type: Race\/Species","movement":{"burrow":-1,"fly":-1,"swim":-1,"hover":-1,"climb":-1,"speed":30},"newFeatures":[{"name":"Celestial Resistance","customFeat":{"featureDescription":"You have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage","name":"Celestial Resistance","isStandard":false,"level":0,"newEffects":{"textbox":false,"resistances":[{"s1":"Necrotic##Radiant","s2":"","type":"resistance","level":0}],"toggeable":false,"textboxInitialValue":""},"tags":"Added","source":{"sourceType":"canon"},"type":"noLevelFeature"},"isCustom":true},{"name":"Choose Ability Scores (+2,+1)","customFeat":{"featureDescription":"When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.

They are descended from humans with a touch of the power of Mount Celestia, the divine realm of many lawful good deities. Aasimar are born to serve as champions of the gods, their births hailed as blessed events. They are a people of otherworldly visages, with luminous features that reveal their celestial heritage.\n\nCelestial Champions\n\nAasimar are placed in the world to serve as guardians of law and good. Their patrons expect them to strike at evil, lead by example, and further the cause of justice.\n\nFrom an early age, an aasimar receives visions and guidance from celestial entities via dreams. These dreams help shape an aasimar, granting a sense of destiny and a desire for righteousness.\n\nEach aasimar can count a specific celestial agent of the gods as a guide. This entity is typically a deva, an angel who acts as a messenger to the mortal world.\n\nHidden Wanderers\n\nWhile aasimar are strident foes of evil, they typically prefer to keep a low profile. An aasimar inevitably draws the attention of evil cultists, fiends, and other enemies of good, all of whom would be eager to strike down a celestial champion if they had the chance.\n\nWhen traveling, aasimar prefer hoods, closed helms, and other gear that allows them to conceal their identities. They nevertheless have no compunction about striking openly at evil. The secrecy they desire is never worth endangering the innocent.\n\nAasimar Guides\n\nAn aasimar, except for one who has turned to evil, has a link to an angelic being. That being—usually a deva—provides guidance to the aasimar, though this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings.\n\nThe angelic being is far from omniscient. Its guidance is based on its understanding of the tenets of law and good, and it might have insight into combating especially powerful evils that it knows about.\n\nConflicted Souls\n\nDespite its celestial origin, an aasimar is mortal and possesses free will. Most aasimar follow their ordained path, but some grow to see their abilities as a curse. These disaffected aasimar are typically content to turn away from the world, but a few become agents of evil. In their minds, their exposure to celestial powers amounted to little more than brainwashing.\n\nEvil aasimar make deadly foes. The radiant power they once commanded becomes corrupted into a horrid, draining magic. And their angelic guides abandon them.\n\nEven aasimar wholly dedicated to good sometimes feel torn between two worlds. The angels that guide them see the world from a distant perch. An aasimar who wishes to stop and help a town recover from a drought might be told by an angelic guide to push forward on a greater quest. To a distant angel, saving a few commoners might pale in comparison to defeating a cult of Orcus. An aasimar’s guide is wise but not infallible.","source":{"book":"Volo's Guide to Monsters","sourceType":"canon"},"is2024":false,"freeSkills":{},"movement":{"swim":-1,"burrow":-1,"speed":30,"fly":-1,"hover":-1,"climb":-1},"heightFeet":-32768,"heightInches":-32768,"selectionSkills":{},"noGenderNames":"","subraces":[{"importRaceName":"Aasimar (Legacy)","customSubrace":{"tags":"Added","name":"Fallen Aasimar","isStandard":false,"numSkillSelections":0,"movement":{"hover":-1,"fly":-1,"speed":-1,"burrow":-1,"climb":-1,"swim":-1},"raceName":"Aasimar (Legacy)","source":{"book":"Volo's Guide to Monsters","sourceType":"canon"},"selectionSkills":{},"freeSkills":{},"newFeatures":[{"isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"newEffects":{"equations":[{"s1":"Necrotic Damage","d5":1,"level":3,"dice":[],"type":"","d1":1,"b5":true},{"s1":"Frightened","d5":1,"level":3,"i1":8,"dice":[],"stats":{"integers":[0,0,0,0,0,0],"doubles":[0,0,0,0,0,1],"stats":{"charisma":true}},"type":"","d1":1,"b5":true}],"textbox":false,"toggeable":false,"textboxInitialValue":""},"name":"Aasimar: Necrotic Shroud","tags":"Added","level":3,"type":"leveledFeature","isStandard":false,"featureDescription":"Your eyes briefly become pools of darkness, and ghostly, flightless wings sprout from your back temporarily.

If you walk alone in the woods, a bugbear will reach out of the bushes and strangle you. If you stray too far from the house at night, bugbears will scoop you up to devour you in their den. If a bugbear cuts off your head, your soul stays trapped inside, and the bugbears use your head to magically command all whom you once knew.\n\nLurid tales such as these have flowered from the seeds of truth. Bugbears do rely on stealth and strength to attack, preferring to operate at night. They do take the heads of enemy leaders, but they are no more likely to eat people indiscriminately than humans are. Bugbears aren’t likely to attack lone travelers or wandering children unless they clearly have something to gain by doing so. From the viewpoint of the rest of the world, their aggression and savagery are thankfully offset by their rarity and lethargy.\n\nShiftless, Savage Layabouts\n\nWhen they’re not in battle, bugbears spend much of their time resting or dozing. They don’t engage in crafting or agriculture to any great extent, or otherwise produce anything of value. They bully weaker creatures into doing their bidding, so they can take it easy. When a superior force tries to intimidate bugbears into service, they will try to escape rather than perform the work or confront the foe. Even when subsumed into a goblinoid host and drawn into war, bugbears must often be roused from naps and bribed to get them to do their duties.\n\nThis indolence offers no clue to how vicious the creatures are. Bugbears are capable of bouts of incredible ferocity, using their muscular bodies to exact swift and ruthless violence. At their core, bugbears are ambush predators accustomed to long periods of inactivity broken by short bursts of murderous energy. Ferocious though they may be, bugbears aren’t built for extended periods of exertion.\n\nGang Mentality\n\nSince bugbears aren’t a particularly fecund race, their overall population is small and spread over a wide area. Bugbears live in family groups that operate much like gangs. The individuals in a group typically number fewer than a dozen, consisting of siblings and their mates as well as a handful of offspring and an elder or two. A gang lives in and around a small enclosure, often a natural cave or an old bear den, and it might have supplementary dens elsewhere in its territory that it uses temporarily when it goes on long forays for food.\n\nIn good times, a bugbear gang is tight-knit, and its members cooperate well when hunting or bullying other creatures. But when the fortunes of a gang turn sour, the individuals become selfish, and might sabotage one another to remove opposition or exile weaker or unpopular members to keep the rest of the gang strong. Fortunately for the race as a whole, even young and elderly bugbears have the ability to survive alone in the wild, and the cast-off members of a gang might eventually catch on with a different group.\n\nLeft to their own devices, bugbears have little more impact on the world than wolf packs. They subsist by crafting simple tools and hunting and gathering food, and gangs sometimes come together peacefully to exchange members and goods between them.\n\nMalevolent Worship of Malign Gods\n\nBugbears worship two deities who are brothers, Hruggek and Grankhul. Hruggek is the fearsome elder sibling, possessed of legendary might and prowess in battle. Bugbears believe their strength and bravery come from him. Cunning Grankhul is the younger one, and in the stories bugbears tell, he gifted them with stealth but in return he sapped their vigor, so that bugbears sleep in his stead while he remains eternally alert and awake.\n\nAccording to bugbear legends, Hruggek and Grankhul often fight alongside each other, preying upon all they encounter as is their right as superior warriors. Hruggek takes the heads of those he kills and puts them on spikes in his den, where they utter pleas for mercy and sing paeans to his might. Grankhul watches over Hruggek when he sleeps, but if he must be elsewhere, he whispers commands to the severed heads to wake Hruggek if any danger threatens him.\n\nBugbears admire the qualities of both brothers. Because of Hruggek, they consider bravery and physical superiority to be their natural state. Thanks to Grankhul, they can use their size and strength to work as stealthy assassins rather than blundering around like ogres.\n\nBullying, murder, and engaging in battle are all holy acts for bugbears. Garroting an unsuspecting creature and defeating foes in open battle are seen as acts of worship, in the same way that dwarves consider metalsmithing to be sacred to Moradin.\n\nThe bugbears recognize two other gods, both of which they disdain and fear: Maglubiyet and Skiggaret.\n\nMaglubiyet, the leader of the goblinoid pantheon, forced both brothers to submit to his rule, but instead of killing them, he showed mercy and even honored them in a way by setting them free — under his control — so that bugbears could continue to employ their talents against his enemies. Bugbears understand that by venerating Hruggek and Grankhul, they also give tribute to Maglubiyet, even though they don’t openly pay homage to their overlord. When bugbears are called to join a host, bugbears believe Maglubiyet has again corralled the brothers into a divine battle, and they honor their gods by following suit.\n\nSkiggaret is the bugbear version of the bogeyman, as hateful and terrifying to them as bugbears are in the eyes of many other races. His name is rarely spoken, and never above a whisper. Skiggaret’s influence manifests at times when bugbears are forced to act in a cowardly fashion; a bugbear that knows or feels itself to be in mortal danger is affected by a form of madness and will do anything, including trying to flee, in order to stay alive. Bugbears believe that this feeling of fear comes from being possessed by Skiggaret, and they don’t relish experiencing it. After the madness has passed, bugbears don’t dwell on things that were done in the presence of Skiggaret. Talking about such acts might call him back.\n\nBlessings of the Bugbear Gods\n\nBugbears have no use for priests or shamans. No one needs to tell them what their gods want. If the brother gods are angry with them, they let the bugbears know with bolts of lightning (Hruggek) or by striking them blind or dead (Grankhul). Bugbears worship their gods simply by preying on other creatures, using no other sort of ceremony to show obeisance — with one exception.\n\nIn an act of worship that also sometimes attracts favorable attention from their gods, bugbears sever the heads of defeated foes, cut away or stitch open the eyelids, and leave the mouths hanging open. The heads are then placed on spikes or hung from cords around a bugbear den. The heads themselves are trophies that honor Hruggek, and their ever-staring eyes are an homage to sleepless Grankhul.\n\nThe heads of leaders and mighty opponents are particularly sacred, and offering up such a trophy can provide a bugbear gang with a special boon. A gang that gains the favor of Hruggek and Grankhul in this way might find that the head will emit a shout when an enemy gets too close (in the fashion of an alarm spell). Sometimes the heads of people who have information the bugbears need speak their secrets amid blubbered pleas for mercy (as with the speak with dead spell).","femaleNames":"","movement":{"burrow":-1,"swim":-1,"fly":-1,"hover":-1,"speed":30,"climb":-1},"lowerAge":16,"newFeatures":[{"customFeat":{"featureDescription":"You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

They race the wind, hooves thundering and tails streaming behind them, until the next wall looms in their path and brings them to a stop.\n\nNature’s Cavalry\nCentaurs have the upper bodies, down to the waist, of muscular humans, displaying all the human variety of skin tones and features. Their ears are slightly pointed, but their faces are wider and squarer than those of elves. Below the waist, they have the bodies of small horses, with a similar range of coloration — from various shades of chestnut or bay to dappled or even zebra-like striped patterns. Most centaurs style their hair and their tails in a similar way. Selesnya centaurs favor long, flowing hair. Gruul centaurs cut their hair in rough, spiky styles.\n\nThe upper bodies of centaurs are comparable to human torsos in size, and their lower equine bodies average about 4 feet tall at the withers. Though they are smaller than a human rider mounted on a horse, they fill similar roles as cavalry warriors, messengers, outriders, and scouts.\n\nAffinity for Nature\nCentaurs have an affinity for the natural world. Among the guilds that share that affinity, centaurs favor the rubblebelts of the Gruul Clans and the wide plazas of the Selesnya Conclave over the undercity tunnels of the Golgari and the laboratories of the Simic.\n\nCentaurs celebrate life and growth, and the birth of a foal is always cause for festivities. At the same time, they revere the traditions of the past, and among both the Gruul and the Selesnya they are voices of memory and history, preserving old ways and keeping alive the legends of ancestral heroes. They feel a close kinship with wild animals, perhaps because of their own horse-like bodies, and delight in the feeling of running alongside herds and packs of other beasts.\n\nClans and Community\nCentaurs sense the interconnectedness of the natural world. Thus, they celebrate family and community as microcosms of that greater connection. Among the Gruul, they have a strong clan identity, and Selesnya centaurs are fiercely loyal to their individual communities as well as the guild as a whole. Their love of history and tradition also means that centaurs are more likely than most other Ravnicans to join the same guild that their parents did.","maleNames":"Bonmod#####Boruvo#####Chodi#####Drozan#####Kozim#####Milosh#####Ninos#####Oleksi#####Orval#####Radom#####Radovas#####Rostis#####Svetyos#####Tomis#####Trijiro#####Vlodim#####Volim#####Yarog","heightFeet":6,"freeSkills":{},"sizes":["Medium"],"isStandard":false,"higherAge":80,"femaleNames":"Daiva#####Dunja#####Elnaya#####Galisnya#####Irinya#####Kotyali#####Lalya#####Litisia#####Madya#####Mira#####Nedja#####Nikya#####Ostani#####Pinya#####Rada#####Raisya#####Stasolya#####Tatna#####Zhendoya#####Zoria","weightPounds":-32768,"is2024":false},{"freePoints":[0,0,2,0,0,0],"numSkillSelections":1,"newFeatures":[{"isCustom":true,"name":"Practical","customFeat":{"type":"noLevelFeature","tags":"Added","level":0,"name":"Practical","newEffects":{"textboxInitialValue":"","textbox":false,"toggeable":false},"featureDescription":"Cervans are eminently practical and like to spend their time learning useful skills for life in their woodland villages.

More insular than other humblefolk, cervans often reside deep in the most ancient parts of Humblewood’s vast forest, in tree stands and groves far from birdfolk perches.\n\nHale and Hearty\n\nCervans have a robust physique and are rarely sick. They are one of the longest-lived races among the humblefolk. Though their wariness has earned them a reputation as timid, cervans are cautious because they remain active and alert, and generally prefer practice to contemplation. Cervans like to pursue skills independently in order to give themselves a sense of purpose. This striving is what propels some cervans to positions of great import throughout the Wood. A happy cervan is one who is hard at work.\n\nWary and Practical\n\nOne of the reasons cervans form such close-knit communities is a mistrust of outsiders. Before the Treaty, vulpin raiders and mapach thieves were serious threats. These times have long since passed, but cervans still possess a wariness that makes it hard for others to gain their trust. After the implementation of the Humblefolk Treaty, many cervans continued to live by the old ways. However, some cervan villages have since started to contain the odd family of jerbeen, or a few lone hedges. Even under such circumstances, cervans have maintained positions of leadership and delegated responsibilities to make sure that villages are run in accordance with the old cervan teachings, ensuring that work necessary for survival in the most remote villages is accomplished, so that all its inhabitants may be kept healthy and happy.\n\nThe ability to balance their innate caution with practical considerations is one of the cervans’ greatest strengths. Cervans teach that the best means of survival in any situation is to remain calm and weigh one’s options. The best cervan leaders favor this approach.\n\nThe Sight\n\nCervans have a unique ability to bounce back and survive a physical shock that might kill others. Occasionally, cervans who survive such traumas are granted mystical visions. Sometimes these are flashes of insight into the world around them, sometimes portents of doom, and other times visions of a far away future. Known among cervans as “The Sight,” this phenomenon is elusive, and out of the control of mortals. Cervans who have seen visions in this way are known as “The Sighted,” and after this initial event, some will suddenly find themselves receptive to visions of the past, present, and future.\n\nA cervan whose Sight has been triggered is encouraged to hone it, so that they might take on the role of a seer within their village. However, these efforts aren’t always met with success. The Sight will sometimes visit a cervan only once in their lifetime, with no amount of training granting a glimpse of such visions again. This is believed to be for the best, as cervans acknowledge that those who are truly Sighted carry knowledge that can be both a blessing and a curse.\n\nThe Blessing of Cairith\n\nWhile it’s not unusual for some cervans to have small antlers or buds visible on their heads, only rarely is a cervan born who can grow a full set of antlers. These cervans are a different subrace—pronghorns—and are thought to be specially blessed by their Amaranthine Cairith, a sacred spirit of life and growth believed to watch over all cervans. Unlike other subraces, pronghorn and grove cervans are the same people. The arrival of a pronghorn cervan is an event to celebrate, as it can occur only once in a generation.","maleNames":"","heightFeet":-32768,"freeSkills":{},"sizes":["Medium"],"isStandard":false,"higherAge":150,"femaleNames":"","weightPounds":-32768,"is2024":false},{"freePoints":[0,0,0,0,0,0],"numSkillSelections":0,"newFeatures":[{"isCustom":true,"name":"Changeling Instincts","customFeat":{"isStandard":false,"name":"Changeling Instincts","newEffects":{"toggeable":false,"textboxInitialValue":"","skills":[{"i3":1,"type":"select","skills":{"skills":{"performance":true,"persuasion":true,"intimidation":true,"deception":true,"insight":true}},"level":0,"i1":2}],"textbox":false},"source":{"book":"Monsters of the Multiverse","sourceType":"canon"},"level":0,"type":"noLevelFeature","featureDescription":"Thanks to your connection to the fey realm, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion.","tags":"Added"}},{"isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"isStandard":false,"name":"Choose Ability Scores (+2,+1)","newEffects":{"toggeable":false,"textboxInitialValue":"","textbox":false,"abilityScores":[{"i1":3,"level":0,"type":"distributePoints","stats":{"doubles":[0,0,0,0,0,0],"integers":[0,0,0,0,0,0],"stats":{"constitution":true,"strength":true,"wisdom":true,"charisma":true,"intelligence":true,"dexterity":true}}}]},"source":{"book":"Monsters of the Multiverse","sourceType":"canon"},"level":0,"type":"noLevelFeature","featureDescription":"When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.

They grow up experiencing the Material Plane from a distance, viewing it through the gray and muffling barrier between the planes of existence. Most ethereans live in small communities spread throughout the Border Ethereal and find joy in poetry, art, and theater that offsets the drab and relative lifelessness of their home. While only a few monsters are able to threaten those on the Border Ethereal, etherean survival is only maintainable through their tenacity and shared sense of decency. For many ethereans, the relative safety of the Ethereal Plane outweighs the richer experiences of the Material, but for those that do manage to cross that planar threshold, there is simply no comparison.\n\nAn Obscure Lineage\n\nEthereans resemble elves with light gray skin, but their hair and eyes are distinctly different. Many ethereans’ eyes and hair are either purple or magenta, but it’s not unheard of for them to come in a full spectrum of colors— a curious result of living extensively on the Ethereal Plane. Further, an etherean’s hair drifts and floats on its own, as if carried by an invisible current, before evaporating into nothing at its ends.\n\nDecent By Necessity\n\nThe Border Ethereal allows for a free range of movement in any direction, including through solid objects located on the Material Plane. As a result, privacy is extremely coveted by those on the Ethereal Plane, who are constantly aware of the near-impossibility of complete safety from others. Over generations, etherean culture has grown to uphold and teach a powerful focus on common decency between them. This often translates to relatively lawful communities among ethereans, who expect that their safety and privacy will be respected in exchange for their own adherence.\n\nHowever, whether it be the result of a possible fey ancestry or defiance of their strict social structure, most ethereans have a deep appreciation of harmless pranks and practical jokes. In general, as long as it’s in good fun, moments of levity like these are part of the fabric that keeps ethereans happy and entertained in an otherwise quiet and dull world.\n\nWorlds to Experience\n\nEthereans typically take up adventuring when the routine of the Border Ethereal no longer interests them. Such ethereans often go searching for a means of travel into the Material Plane, but only some manage to find them. Those that do are thrust into a world suddenly bound by gravity and rife with danger, but also filled with opportunity and new experiences. Many ethereans will happily accept contracts to travel great distances or visit exotic realms, regardless of danger, in order to make the most of their life beyond the Border Ethereal.\n\nEthereans will often choose to spend their coin on brightly colored and ostentatious clothing, seemingly making up for the limited color palettes they may have experienced on the Border Ethereal. Others fall victim to new vices, but more often than not, strict etherean resourcefulness is enough to prevent all but the most vulnerable ethereans from becoming addicted to the pleasures of the Material Plane.","numSkillSelections":0,"maleNames":"","name":"Etherean","freeSkills":{},"femaleNames":"","isStandard":false,"heightFeet":-32768,"higherAge":90,"sizes":["Medium"],"weightPounds":-32768,"source":{"customName":"The Griffin's Saddlebag","page":204,"sourceType":"homebrew"},"subraces":[],"movement":{"swim":-1,"fly":-1,"hover":-1,"speed":30,"burrow":-1,"climb":-1},"noGenderNames":"Antham#####Cheyl#####Corifir#####Crena#####Destva#####Euranya#####Genoven#####Hanshen#####Hosh#####Irsht#####Jeun#####Kline#####Krimme#####Luddin#####Osvo#####Ozla#####Pragil#####Prinn#####Quord#####Tresht#####Tryll#####Ulram#####Ura#####Vass#####Vertra"},{"higherAge":0,"sizes":["Small"],"is2024":false,"name":"Fairy","tags":"Added#####Type: Race\/Species","weightPounds":-32768,"movement":{"swim":-1,"fly":-1,"hover":-1,"speed":30,"burrow":-1,"climb":-1},"heightInches":-32768,"newFeatures":[{"isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"tags":"Added","newEffects":{"toggeable":false,"textbox":false,"textboxInitialValue":"","abilityScores":[{"level":0,"stats":{"integers":[0,0,0,0,0,0],"doubles":[0,0,0,0,0,0],"stats":{"wisdom":true,"constitution":true,"charisma":true,"strength":true,"intelligence":true,"dexterity":true}},"i1":3,"type":"distributePoints"}]},"source":{"sourceType":"canon","book":"Monsters of the Multiverse"},"type":"noLevelFeature","featureDescription":"When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.

Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children’s children will always be held accountable.\n\nInfernal Bloodline\n\nTieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, they still look human. However, their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle’s, and some spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns. They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors—black, red, white, silver, or gold—with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.\n\nSelf-Reliant and Suspicious\n\nTieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.\n\nLacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for life","subraces":[]},{"higherAge":500,"sizes":["Medium"],"is2024":false,"name":"Firbolg","tags":"Added#####Type: Race\/Species","weightPounds":-32768,"movement":{"climb":-1,"fly":-1,"swim":-1,"speed":30,"burrow":-1,"hover":-1},"heightInches":-32768,"newFeatures":[{"isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"name":"Choose Ability Scores (+2,+1)","type":"noLevelFeature","source":{"sourceType":"canon","book":"Monsters of the Multiverse"},"newEffects":{"toggeable":false,"textbox":false,"textboxInitialValue":"","abilityScores":[{"i1":3,"type":"distributePoints","level":0,"stats":{"stats":{"dexterity":true,"intelligence":true,"constitution":true,"strength":true,"wisdom":true,"charisma":true},"integers":[0,0,0,0,0,0],"doubles":[0,0,0,0,0,0]}}]},"featureDescription":"When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.

When provoked, firbolgs demonstrate formidable skills with weapons and druidic magic.\n\nHumble Guardians\n\nFirbolgs love nothing more than a peaceful day spent among the trees of an old forest. They see forests as sacred places, representing the heart of the world and monuments to the durability of life.\n\nIn their role as caretakers, firbolgs live off the land while striving to remain in balance with nature. Their methods reflect common sense and remarkable resourcefulness. During a bountiful summer, they store away excess nuts, fruit, and berries. When winter arrives, they scatter everything they can spare to ensure the animals of the wood survive until springtime.\n\nIn a firbolg’s eyes, there is no greater fault than greed. The firbolgs believe that the world remains healthiest when each creature takes only what it needs. Material goods, especially precious gems and gold, have little appeal to them. What use are such things when winter lingers and food runs short?\n\nNatural Druids\n\nFirbolgs have a talent for druidic magic. Their cultural reverence for nature, combined with their strong and insightful minds, makes learning such magic an instinctive part of their development. Almost every firbolg learns a few spells, typically those used to mask their presence, and many go on to master nature magic.\n\nFirbolgs who become druids serve as stronghold leaders. With every action the tribe takes, the druids weigh not only the group’s needs, but the effect each action will have on the forest and the rest of the natural world. Firbolg tribes would rather go hungry than strain the land during a famine.\n\nHidden Shepherds\n\nAs caretakers of the land, firbolgs prefer to remain out of sight and out of mind. They don’t try to dominate nature, but rather seek to ensure that it prospers and survives according to its own laws.\n\nFirbolgs use their magic to keep their presence in a forest secret. This approach allows them to avoid the politics and struggles of elves, humans, and orcs. Such events concern the firbolgs only when the events affect the forest.\n\nEven in the face of an intrusion, firbolgs prefer a subtle, gentle approach to prevent damage to their territory. They employ their magic to make the forest an unappealing place to explore by temporarily diverting springs, driving away game, stealing critical tools, and altering trails to leave hunting or lumber parties hopelessly lost. The firbolgs’ presence is marked by an absence of animals and a strange quiet, as if the forest wishes to avoid attracting attention to itself. The faster travelers decide to move on, the better.\n\nIf these tactics fail, the firbolgs take more direct action. Their observations of a settlement determine what happens next. If the outsiders seem peaceful, the firbolgs approach and gently ask them to leave, even offering food and other supplies to aid their departure. If those who insist on remaining respect nature, take only what they need, and live in harmony with the wood, firbolgs explore the possibility of friendship with them, as long as the outsiders vow to safeguard the forest. If the settlers clearly display evil intentions, however, the firbolgs martial their strength and magic for a single overwhelming attack.\n\nOutcast Adventurers\n\nAs guardians of the wood, few firbolgs would dream of leaving their homes or attempting to fit into human society. An exiled firbolg, or one whose clan has been destroyed, might not have a choice in the matter. Most adventuring firbolgs fall into this latter category.\n\nOutcast firbolgs can never return home. They committed some unforgivable deed, usually something that put their homeland at risk, such as starting a forest fire or killing a rare or beautiful wild creature. These firbolgs are loners who wander the world in hope of finding a new place to call home.\n\nOrphaned firbolgs are those whose clans or homelands have been destroyed. They become crusaders for nature, seeking to avenge their loss and prevent the further destruction of the natural world.\n\nA few rare firbolgs are entrusted by their clan with an important mission that takes them beyond their homes. These firbolgs feel like pilgrims in a strange land, and usually they wish only to complete their quests and return home as quickly as possible.","subraces":[]},{"weightPounds":-32768,"lowerAge":0,"subraces":[],"isStandard":false,"newFeatures":[{"customFeat":{"name":"Choose Ability Scores (+2,+1)","newEffects":{"textbox":false,"toggeable":false,"textboxInitialValue":"","abilityScores":[{"i1":3,"type":"distributePoints","level":0,"stats":{"doubles":[0,0,0,0,0,0],"stats":{"wisdom":true,"intelligence":true,"strength":true,"charisma":true,"constitution":true,"dexterity":true},"integers":[0,0,0,0,0,0]}}]},"source":{"book":"Monsters of the Multiverse","sourceType":"canon"},"type":"noLevelFeature","featureDescription":"When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.

Of the birdfolk, they are the most likely to be found living among the humblefolk. Gallus have a deep respect for nature and a love of gardening unmatched by other birdfolk. They value their social bonds above all else, and are always ready to help their neighbors and promote the common good. They are polite but have little patience for deceit and rudeness.\n\nA Varied Folk\n\nThe gallus are a varied folk, resembling as many different varieties of wildfowl as there are trees in the Wood. Some are pheasant-like, others are grouse-like, while some resemble chickens or turkeys. There are dozens of variations of feathers, colors, and patterns even between gallus of the same subrace. The gallus are proud of their appearances but not to the point of vanity. Maintaining good grooming is akin to keeping a knife sharp and shows a level of respect for oneself.\n\nBirdfolk are generally welcoming to other races, but the gallus are particularly well-known for their willingness to include virtually anyone in social or familial groups. In gallus culture, it is customary to always offer your seat at a table to guests. This is seen as the basis of a popular and hilarious children’s story about a meal growing too cold to eat as the gallus continually give up their seats to late arrivals at a party.\n\nSalt of the Earth\n\nGallus are a social and communal folk. They tend to form close-knit communities wherever they roost, and their sense of pride for their community runs deep. When tragedy leaves children in their village orphaned, it is customary for gallus families to take them in. Gallus value honest work, such as farming and smithing, and share labor equally between all community members.

When a skeleton suspended in an ooze is subjected to necromancy that would normally transform it into a mindless thrall, it’s possible for the ooze to magically connect to the reanimated body, and its departed life, instead. This event is called Synthesis, and it’s through this process that the fragments of life held by ooze and skeleton can come together to form a complete whole. Occasionally called Symblexes for their parallels to other intelligent oozes, geletons are given a rare second chance at life—one that they are as moldable to as their gelatinous forms themselves.\n\nA Brand New Life\n\nAt the start of their new lives, geletons are featureless, ooze-covered humanoids with only a spark of traditional consciousness. Over time, usually about a month, this small consciousness grows into a fully sentient being just like any other. During this period, a geleton’s appearance also becomes more discernable, and eventually grows into a humanoid form that feels natural to its budding sense of self. The memories from any of their previous lives are lost in this process, but can resurface in pieces through hazy dreams or waves of déjà vu.\n\nWithout a unified culture or history, each geleton’s story is unique. Many geletons adopt attitudes similar to those close to them early on in their lives, but others develop strong personalities entirely on their own.\n\nDangerous Beginnings\n\nBy their very nature, almost all geletons come to life in dangerous places. For however many there are in the world, there are countless more that inevitably perished shortly after their creation. Some unscrupulous figures—typically necromancers or mad scientists—try to use the process of Synthesis for personal gain, but are for the most part stopped whenever they’re discovered. Geletons created and held captive in such harrowing conditions for a long time often carry a deep-seated fear or resentment for necromancy, if not all magic, for the remainder of their lives. Other geletons created in such conditions recover faster, especially if they are found and rescued shortly after their Synthesis. Regardless, the origins of virtually all geletons are rife with danger, and those that are brought into safety early in their lives are counted among the most lucky.\n\nUnusual Appearance\n\nBy far, gelatinous cubes are the most common subject of Synthesis. These clear oozes are known to carry skeletal remains longer than others, and in doing so have a higher chance of becoming a geleton. As a result, most geletons’ bodies are similarly translucent. When other oozes like black puddings or ochre jellies undergo Synthesis, the resulting geleton’s appearance is typically more opaque.\n\nRegardless of the ooze, a geleton’s form always reflects their desired features. Most eventually resemble humans or elves, but when a dragonborn or tiefling skeleton is used in Synthesis, their appearance will often reflect that ancestry in some capacity. Similarly, all geletons have a viscous sheen to their bodies, and though they may have the appearance of hair or eyes, they are still fully gelatinous in nature.","source":{"sourceType":"homebrew","customName":"The Griffin's Saddlebag","page":206},"heightInches":-32768,"newLanguages":[{"language":"Common","isCustom":false}],"freeSkills":{},"freePoints":[0,0,2,0,0,0],"maleNames":"","sizes":["Small","Medium"],"is2024":false},{"heightInches":-32768,"freePoints":[0,0,2,0,0,0],"weightPounds":-32768,"colorIndex":6,"tags":"Added#####Legacy#####Type: Race\/Species","maleNames":"","is2024":false,"sizes":["Medium"],"raceDescription":"Those who think of other planes at all consider them remote, distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth, carry the power of the planes in their blood. The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.\n\nThe Elemental Planes are often inhospitable to natives of the Material Plane: crushing earth, searing flames, boundless skies, and endless seas make visiting these places dangerous for even a short time. The powerful genies, however, don’t face such troubles when venturing into the mortal world. They adapt well to the mingled elements of the Material Plane, and they sometimes visit—whether of their own volition or compelled by magic. Some genies can adopt mortal guise and travel incognito.\n\nDuring these visits, a mortal might catch a genie’s eye. Friendship forms, romance blooms, and sometimes children result. These children are genasi: individuals with ties to two worlds, yet belonging to neither. Some genasi are born of mortal–genie unions, others have two genasi as parents, and a rare few have a genie further up their family tree, manifesting an elemental heritage that’s lain dormant for generations.\n\nOccasionally, genasi result from exposure to a surge of elemental power, through phenomena such as an eruption from the Inner Planes or a planar convergence. Elemental energy saturates any creatures in the area and might alter their nature enough that their offspring with other mortals are born as genasi.\n\nHeirs to Elemental Power\n\nGenasi inherit something from both sides of their dual nature. They resemble humans but have unusual skin color (red, green, blue, or gray), and there is something odd about them. The elemental blood flowing through their veins manifests differently in each genasi, often as magical power.\n\nSeen in silhouette, a genasi can usually pass for human. Those of earth or water descent tend to be heavier, while those of air or fire tend to be lighter. A given genasi might have some features reminiscent of the mortal parent (pointed ears from an elf, a stockier frame and thick hair from a dwarf, small hands and feet from a halfling, exceedingly large eyes from a gnome, and so on).\n\nGenasi almost never have contact with their elemental parents. Genies seldom have interest in their mortal offspring, seeing them as accidents. Many feel nothing for their genasi children at all.\n\nSome genasi live as outcasts, driven into exile for their unsettling appearance and strange magic, or assuming leadership of savage humanoids and weird cults in untamed lands. Others gain positions of great influence, especially where elemental beings are revered. A few genasi leave the Material Plane to find refuge in the households of their genie parents.\n\nWild and Confident\n\nGenasi rarely lack confidence, seeing themselves as equal to almost any challenge in their path. This certainty might manifest as graceful self-assurance in one genasi and as arrogance in another. Such self- confidence can sometimes blind genasi to risk, and their great plans often get them and others into trouble.\n\nToo much failure can chip away at even a genasi’s sense of self, so they constantly push themselves to improve, honing their talents and perfecting their craft.\n\nGenasi Lands\n\nAs rare beings, genasi might go their entire lives without encountering another one of their kind. There are no great genasi cities or empires. Genasi seldom have communities of their own and typically adopt the cultures and societies into which they are born. The more strange their appearance, the harder time they have. Many genasi lose themselves in teeming cities, where their distinctiveness hardly raises an eyebrow in places accustomed to a variety of different people.\n\nGENASI ON ATHAS\n\nAlthough any world that includes one or more elemental planes can feature genasi, on Athas, the world of the Dark Sun campaign setting, elemental forces hold greater sway than they do on other worlds. As a people touched by elemental power, genasi are viewed as seers, prophets, and chosen ones. The birth of a genasi, whether a slave, a noble, or a member of a desert tribe, is an auspicious event. Most Athasians believe a given genasi is destined for greatness—or infamy\n\nThose living on the frontier, though, have a much harder time. People there tend to be less accepting of differences. Sometimes a cold shoulder and a suspicious glare are the best genasi can hope for; in more backward places, they face ostracism and even violence from people who mistake them for fiends.\n\nFacing a hard life, these genasi seek isolation in the wilds, making their homes in mountains or forests, near lakes, or underground.\n\nMost air and fire genasi in the Realms are descendants of the djinn and efreet who once ruled Calimshan. When those rulers were overthrown, their planetouched children were scattered. Over thousands of years, the bloodlines of those genasi have spread into other lands. Though far from common, air and fire genasi are more likely to be found in the western regions of Faerûn, along the coast from Calimshan north up to the Sword Coast, and into the Western Heartlands to the east. Some remain in their ancient homeland.\n\nIn contrast, water and earth genasi have no common history. Individuals have difficulty tracing their own lineage, and bloodlines occasionally skip a generation or two. Many earth genasi originated in the North and spread out from there. Water genasi come from coastal areas, the largest concentration of them hailing from the regions surrounding the Sea of Fallen Stars.\n\nThe distant land of Zakhara is known only in legends to most inhabitants of Faerûn. There, genies and spellcasters enter into bargains, and genasi can result from such pacts. Those genasi have been sources of great weal and woe in the history of that land.","movement":{"swim":-1,"fly":-1,"hover":-1,"climb":-1,"speed":30,"burrow":-1},"heightFeet":-32768,"higherAge":120,"subraces":[{"importRaceName":"Genasi (Legacy)","isCustom":true,"customSubrace":{"tags":"Added#####Legacy#####Type: Race\/Species","freePoints":[0,1,0,0,0,0],"isStandard":false,"newFeatures":[{"name":"Mingle With The Wind (Legacy)","customFeat":{"newEffects":{"textboxInitialValue":"","charges":[{"d1":1,"type":"","i5":1,"level":0,"i1":1}],"textbox":false,"toggeable":false,"spells":[{"type":"select","b1":true,"casters":[],"level":0,"spells":[{"type":"spell","isCustom":false,"name":"Levitate"}],"i1":1}]},"name":"Mingle With The Wind (Legacy)","featureDescription":"You can cast the levitate spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest.

Cunning in battle and cruel in victory, goblins are fawning and servile in defeat, just as in their own society lower castes must scrape before those of greater status and as goblin tribes bow before other goblinoids.\n\nBeast Masters and Slave Drivers\n\nGoblins know they are a weak, unsophisticated race that can be easily dominated by bigger, smarter, more organized, more ferocious, or more magical creatures. Their god was conquered by Maglubiyet, after all, and now when the Mighty One calls for it, even their souls are forfeit. It is this realization that drives them to dominate other creatures whenever they can — for goblins, life is short.\n\nGoblins seek to trap and enslave any creatures they encounter, but they flee from opposition that seems too daunting. For miles around their lair, they employ pit traps, snares, and nets to catch the unwary, and when their hunting patrols encounter other beings, they always look for ways to capture their foes instead of killing them. Goblins that run up against the fringes of a society first test its defenses by stealing objects, and if these crimes go unpunished, they begin stealing people.\n\nEnslaved creatures receive the worst treatment the goblins can dish out while still getting decent performance out of the slaves. But humanoids and monsters that are especially capable or that provide unusual services find themselves treated like favored (though occasionally abused) pets.\n\nVirtually any kind of creature that can be browbeaten into service might be found with a goblin tribe, but rats and wolves are nearly always present. Both have lived in concert with goblins for at least as long as humans have worked with dogs and horses, and in goblin society those two animals serve similar purposes.\n\nFamily Matters\n\nA goblin tribe is organized in a four-tiered caste system made up of lashers, hunters, gatherers, and pariahs. The status of every family in the tribe is based on its importance to the tribe’s survival. Families that belong to the higher-ranking castes keep their status by not sharing their knowledge and skills with other families, while those in the lower castes have little hope of escaping their plight.\n\nOutsiders who don’t understand the goblins’ social system are sometimes surprised by how different castes interact with them. A single human warrior might frighten away a dozen gatherers, only to be shocked when two hunters viciously attack. A captured group of invaders might hang in a net while dozens of goblins pass by and pay them no heed until a group of gatherers shows up.\n\nLashers. The closest thing a goblin tribe has to nobility is the caste of lashers — families of goblins trained in the ways of battle, and also possessed of key skills such as strategy, trap-building, beast taming, mining, smelting, forging, and religion. If the tribe has any spellcasters, this caste includes them. Lashers follow the lead of the tribe’s boss, and enforce their will on other goblins with whips.\n\nHunters. The families of goblins that are skilled in the use of weapons but not privy to any other special knowledge have the second highest status in the tribe. Hunters are often the best wolf riders and know the most about the territory farthest from the tribe’s lair. These individuals hunt game in peaceful times, and in combat they serve as scouts, foot soldiers, and cavalry.\n\nGatherers. Families in the second lowest caste are responsible for getting food from the surrounding area, taking what’s naturally available or stealing whatever they can. Gatherers also do the little amount of farming of which goblins are capable and are charged with checking traps for captured people or beasts. Gatherers aren’t usually armed with weapons more deadly than a sling or a knife, but they frequently carry nets, caltrops, lassos, and nooses on poles for controlling captured creatures. These goblins cook for the tribe, and in times of war they are also responsible for making poison.\n\nGatherers, and the pariahs beneath them, greatly fear for their lives in battle, believing that the lashers and the hunters have special knowledge of how to survive. It is the members of the lower castes that give goblins their reputation for cowardice.\n\nPariahs. Some goblin families are the lowest of the low, composed of the most dimwitted, least educated, and weakest goblins. They get the worst jobs: mucking out animal pens, cleaning up after other goblins, and doing any hard labor such as digging mines. If the goblin tribe has slaves to do some of this work, the pariah families enjoy the opportunity to supervise and dominate such creatures, which have no status at all.","maleNames":"","noGenderNames":"","heightFeet":3,"is2024":false,"newFeatures":[{"name":"Darkvision","isCustom":false,"customFeat":{"tags":"Darkvision#####Hardcoded Content#####Type: Feature","level":0,"isStandard":true,"featureDescription":"You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

Their hearts are infused with the cold regard of their frigid realm, leaving each goliath with the responsibility to earn a place in the tribe or die trying.\n\nDriven Competitors\n\nEvery day brings a new challenge to a goliath. Food, water, and shelter are rare in the uppermost mountain reaches. A single mistake can bring doom to an entire tribe, while an individual’s heroic effort can ensure the entire group’s survival.\n\nGoliaths thus place a premium on self-sufficiency and individual skill. They have a compulsion to keep score, counting their deeds and tallying their accomplishments to compare to others. Goliaths love to win, but they see defeat as a prod to improve their skills.\n\nThis dedication to competition has a dark side. Goliaths are ferocious competitors, but above all else they are driven to outdo their past efforts. If a goliath slays a dragon, he or she might seek out a larger, more powerful wyrm to battle. Few goliath adventurers reach old age, as most die attempting to surpass their past accomplishments.\n\nFair Play\n\nFor goliaths, competition exists only when it is supported by a level playing field. Competition measures talent, dedication, and effort. Those factors determine survival in their home territory, not reliance on magic items, money, or other elements that can tip the balance one way or the other. Goliaths happily rely on such benefits, but they are careful to remember that such an advantage can always be lost. A goliath who relies too much on them can grow complacent, a recipe for disaster in the mountains.\n\nThis trait manifests most strongly when goliaths interact with other folk. The relationship between peasants and nobles puzzles goliaths. If a king lacks the intelligence or leadership to lead, then clearly the most talented person in the kingdom should take his place. Goliaths rarely keep such opinions to themselves, and mock folk who rely on society’s structures or rules to maintain power.\n\nSurvival of the Fittest\n\nAmong goliaths, any adult who can’t contribute to the tribe is expelled. A lone goliath has little chance of survival, especially an older or weaker one. Goliaths have little pity for adults who can’t take care of themselves, though a sick or injured individual is treated, as a result of the goliath concept of fair play.\n\nA permanently injured goliath is still expected to pull his or her weight in the tribe. Typically, such a goliath dies attempting to keep up, or the goliath slips away in the night to seek the cold will of fate.\n\nIn some ways, the goliath drive to outdo themselves feeds into the grim inevitability of their decline and death. A goliath would much rather die in battle, at the peak of strength and skill, than endure the slow decay of old age. Few folk have ever meet an elderly goliath, and even those goliaths who have left their people grapple with the urge to give up their lives as their physical skills decay.\n\nBecause of their risk-taking, goliath tribes suffer from a chronic lack of the experience offered by long- term leaders. They hope for innate wisdom in their leadership, for they can rarely count on a wisdom grown with age.","colorIndex":6,"higherAge":80,"maleNames":"","subraces":[],"name":"Goliath (Legacy)","tags":"Added#####Legacy#####Type: Race\/Species","source":{"sourceType":"canon","book":"Elemental Evil Player's Companion"},"isStandard":false,"newLanguages":[{"language":"Common","isCustom":false},{"language":"Giant","isCustom":false}],"freeSkills":{"athletics":true},"movement":{"climb":-1,"burrow":-1,"speed":30,"hover":-1,"swim":-1,"fly":-1},"numSkillSelections":0,"newFeatures":[{"name":"Mountain Born","isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"newEffects":{"textbox":false,"resistances":[{"s2":"","s1":"Cold","type":"resistance","level":0}],"textboxInitialValue":"","toggeable":false},"source":{"book":"Monsters of the Multiverse","page":21,"sourceType":"canon"},"type":"noLevelFeature","level":0,"isStandard":false,"featureDescription":"You have resistance to cold damage.

They are fiercely territorial and see themselves as superior to most other creatures.\n\nTree-Dwelling Amphibians. Grungs live in trees and prefer shade. A grung hatchery is maintained in well-guarded ground-level pools. About three months after hatching, a grung tadpole takes on the shape of an adult. It takes another six to nine months for a grung juvenile to reach maturity.\n\nCastes and Colors. Grung society is a caste system. Each caste lays eggs in a separate hatching pool, and juvenile grungs join their caste upon emergence from the hatchery. All grungs are a dull greenish gray when they are born, but each individual takes on the color of its caste as it grows to adulthood.\n\nGreen grungs are the tribe’s warriors, hunters, and laborers, and blue grungs work as artisans and in other domestic roles. Supervising and guiding both groups are the purple grungs, which serve as administrators and commanders.\n\nRed grungs are the tribe’s scholars and magic users. They are superior to purple, blue, and green grungs and given proper respect even by grungs of higher status. \n\nHigher castes include orange grungs, which are elite warriors that have authority over all lesser grungs, and gold grungs, which hold the highest leadership positions. A tribe’s sovereign is always a gold grung.\n\nA grung normally remains in its caste for life. On rare occasions, an individual that distinguishes itself with great deeds can earn an invitation to join a higher caste. Through a combination of herbal tonics and ritual magic, an elevated grung changes color and is inducted into its new caste in the same way that a juvenile of the caste would be. From then on, the grung and its progeny are members of the higher caste.\n\nNaturally Toxic. All grungs secrete a substance that is harmless to them but poisonous to other creatures. A grung also uses venom to poison its weapons.\n\nSlavers. Grungs are always on the lookout for creatures they can capture and enslave. Grungs use slaves for all manner of menial tasks, but mostly they just like bossing them around. Slaves are fed mildly poisoned food to keep them lethargic and compliant. A creature afflicted in this way over a long period of time becomes a shell of its former self and can be restored to normalcy only by magic.","colorIndex":18,"higherAge":50,"maleNames":"","subraces":[],"name":"Grung","tags":"Added#####Type: Race\/Species","source":{"book":"One Grung Above","sourceType":"canon","page":4},"isStandard":false,"newLanguages":[{"customLanguage":{"isStandard":false,"additionalInformation":"","tags":"Added","source":{"book":"One Grung Above","page":4,"sourceType":"canon"},"name":"Grung"},"language":"Grung","isCustom":true},{"language":"Common","isCustom":false}],"freeSkills":{"perception":true},"movement":{"climb":25,"burrow":-1,"speed":25,"hover":-1,"swim":-1,"fly":-1},"numSkillSelections":0,"newFeatures":[{"name":"Amphibious","isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"newEffects":{"textbox":false,"toggeable":false,"textboxInitialValue":""},"source":{"page":35,"book":"Monsters of the Multiverse","sourceType":"canon"},"type":"noLevelFeature","level":0,"isStandard":false,"featureDescription":"You can breathe air and water","name":"Amphibious","tags":"Added"}},{"name":"Arboreal Alertness","isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"newEffects":{"textboxInitialValue":"","textbox":false,"toggeable":false},"source":{"book":"One Grung Above","sourceType":"canon","page":4},"type":"noLevelFeature","level":0,"isStandard":false,"featureDescription":"You have proficiency in the Perception skill.","name":"Arboreal Alertness","tags":"Added"}},{"name":"Poison Immunity","isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"newEffects":{"textbox":false,"resistances":[{"s2":"Poisoned","level":0,"s1":"","type":"conditionImmunity"},{"s2":"","level":0,"s1":"Poison","type":"immunity"}],"textboxInitialValue":"","toggeable":false},"source":{"sourceType":"canon","book":"One Grung Above","page":4},"type":"noLevelFeature","level":0,"isStandard":false,"featureDescription":"You’re immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition","name":"Poison Immunity","tags":"Added"}},{"name":"Poisonous Skin","isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"newEffects":{"textbox":false,"textboxInitialValue":"","toggeable":false,"equations":[{"d1":1,"level":0,"dice":[{"type":4,"colorIndex":0,"damageType":"Poison","proficiency":false,"spellLevel":0,"mods":{},"level":0,"classLevel":0,"spellAttackBonus":false,"base":0,"slotLevel":0,"num":2,"halfMod":false,"expertise":false}],"s1":"Poisonous Skin","type":""}]},"source":{"page":4,"book":"One Grung Above","sourceType":"canon"},"type":"noLevelFeature","level":0,"isStandard":false,"featureDescription":"Any creature that grapples you or otherwise comes into direct contact with your skin must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute.

They resemble hedgehogs, although the quills that cover their backs are far tougher, hard enough to repel blades and sharp enough to pierce the solid hides of monstrous creatures. Despite their sturdiness, hedges are sensitive and emotional creatures, who display meekness more than bravado. Their meek demeanor and deference in social situations has earned them a reputation as cowards in the eyes of outsiders. But rather than being born of cowardice, their behavior stems from a desire to respect the feelings and sensitivities of others, something considered to be of utmost importance in hedge society.\n\nSensitive and Kind\n\nHedges have an incredible capacity for empathy, and tend to view all creatures, from the smallest beetle to the largest beast, as being equally deserving of respect and dignity. They are known across the Wood for being excellent conflict mediators, and usually find themselves acting as diplomats or emissaries between factions trying to broker an agreement.\n\nHedges feel most at home when everyone gets along. They are one of the few races who truly understand that conflict is not an evil force but simply represents an imbalance which must be resolved. This is not to say that hedges have never known strife, only that their proactive approach to mediation, coupled with their deep respect for the dignity of all living creatures, results in fewer occasions for conflict. Yet, when a serious conflict does arise, hedges who feel they have been truly and deeply wronged can close themselves off from the rest of their society, sometimes resulting in splits in a community.\n\nOne of the reasons hedges display such deep empathy and compassion towards others is due to the intensity of the emotions they feel. The strength of these emotions applies as much to positive feelings it does negative, meaning emotional wounds run deep with hedges.\n\nOne With the Forest\n\nGifted with a unique connection to the Great Rhythm, hedges are tied into the natural world in a fashion similar to the connection possessed by some gallus. This has granted hedges special magical gifts, such as the ability to speak with the smallest ground-dwelling creatures in the Wood, and the power to cause flowers to bloom. It is quite common for hedges to have a variety of animal friends who share their home.\n\nHedges who dwell outside of the birdfolk cities prefer to live in individual burrows under the great roots of trees. Communities of hedges enjoy living surrounded by nature, near clearings within the forest or lone copses. Central meeting areas and communal gardens can be constructed in the spaces between burrows. Hedges love gardening, and tend to keep a few small gardens wherever they live.\n\nDressed for Comfort\n\nHedges need special consideration when wearing clothes, and favor loose tunics, baggy trousers, flowing robes, and other clothes which fit easily over their quills. When not actively flared out, these tough quills naturally flatten, becoming smooth to the touch. However, if suddenly frightened, their quills reflexively flare out and stiffen, an accident which can ruin a hedge’s clothing.\n\nAdventuring clothes made specifically for hedges are available in nearly every major city in Humblewood, and tailors throughout the Wood are familiar with making alterations to suit a hedge’s needs.","isNoGenderName":true,"colorIndex":9,"selectionSkills":{},"isStandard":false,"noGenderNames":"","heightFeet":3,"maleNames":"","sizes":["Small"],"lowerAge":20,"name":"Hedge","subraces":[],"source":{"page":24,"sourceType":"homebrew","customName":"Humblewood Campaign Setting "},"is2024":false,"freeSkills":{},"newFeatures":[{"customFeat":{"newEffects":{"toggeable":false,"textboxInitialValue":"","textbox":false},"name":"Curl Up","isStandard":false,"featureDescription":"You can use your action to curl up, exposing attackers to a wall of your toughened quills.

When hobgoblins aren’t waging war, they farm, they build, and they practice both martial and arcane arts.\n\nThese trappings of civil society do little to conceal an underlying brutality that hobgoblins practice on each other and perfect upon other races. Punishment for infractions of hobgoblin law are swift and merciless. Beauty is something hobgoblins associate only with images of conflict and warfare.\n\nThe iron grip their philosophy holds on their hearts blinds hobgoblins to the accomplishments of other peoples. Hobgoblins have little appreciation or patience for art. They leave little space for joy or leisure in their lives, and thus have no reserves of faith to call upon when in dire straits.\n\nImplacable Gods\n\nHobgoblins revere two gods unique to their race, the only survivors of a pantheon that was decimated by Maglubiyet so long ago that hobgoblins don’t remember the names of the fallen. Nomog-Geaya is the greater of the two and the more frequently honored. He is seen as a stoic, cold-blooded, and tyrannical leader, and hobgoblins believe he expects the same behavior from them. Bargrivyek is a god of duty, unity, and discipline, and he is thought to be pleased by displays of those principles.\n\nIn the stories that hobgoblins tell one another, Bargrivyek serves as Nomog-Geaya’s second in command. Nomog-Geaya would prefer the position were filled by someone more like himself, but Bargrivyek was all he was left with after Maglubiyet’s conquest. Although both deities are ultimately beholden to Maglubiyet, the greater god allows them to retain a measure of their influence over the hobgoblins because their philosophies are in line with his own.\n\nHobgoblins don’t build temples to their gods, lest they displease Maglubiyet, but the few priests among them do tend small shrines and interpret the body of legends about their gods. Nomog-Geaya’s priests always wield his favored weapons, a longsword and a handaxe. They are responsible for martial training as well as instruction in strategy and battlefield tactics. Bargrivyek’s priests wield his symbol, a flail with a head dipped in white paint. They work as a police force in hobgoblin society, making judgments about honor, mediating disputes, and otherwise enforcing discipline.\n\nRank, Status, and Title\n\nAs in any strict military hierarchy, every hobgoblin in a legion has a rank, from the warlord down through a cadre of officers to the soldiers that make up most of its number. These ranks, using the titles most often applied to them, are as follows:\n\n1st rank: Warlord\n\n2nd rank: General\n\n3rd rank: Captain\n\n4th rank: Fatal Axe\n\n5th rank: Spear\n\n6th rank: Fist\n\n7th rank: Soldier\n\nA legion is organized into units called banners, each one made up of a group of interrelated families. Members of a banner live, work, and fight together, and each banner has a separate status within the legion that is reflected in the power of its officers. For instance, the captains of the highest-ranking banners can expect their orders to be followed by the captains of any banners of lower rank.\n\nRank and responsibility aren’t necessarily commensurate from one legion to another or even between banners in the same legion. A phalanx of foot soldiers led by a captain in one legion might be two hundred strong, while in another such a force numbers just twenty. One banner might have four warriors mounted on worgs led by a fist, while a fist in another banner of the same legion might lead ten mounted warriors. If any rank doesn’t serve a purpose in the legion, the warlord eliminates it from the hierarchy to maximize efficiency.\n\nHonor Bound, By Glory Crowned\n\nAdvancement in rank comes as a result of attaining glory, but for the achievement to mean anything, a hobgoblin must abide by the race’s code of honor in doing so.\n\nGlory can be earned by discovery of great resources (such as finding a new vein of iron or a powerful magic item), by fine performances (writing and performing a great ballad about the legion), by designing and constructing a great defense or monument, and through other means. But the greatest respect is reserved for those who earn their glory in battle. In theory, the fortunes of war can elevate the lowest-ranking banner in a legion to the highest status. In practice, warlords are careful to position themselves and their banners to claim the greatest victories in any conflict, and they portion out opportunities and responsibilities to other banners as politics dictate.\n\nEach hobgoblin legion has a distinct code of honor and law, but all follow a few general precepts that are at the heart of the hobgoblin honor system.\n\nFollow Orders. Carrying out orders without question is critical on the battlefield, and hobgoblins follow this dictum in peaceful times as well in order to maintain stability in their society. Hobgoblins don’t shrink from following orders that they know will result in death if the act will bring glory to the banner or the legion.\n\nHonor the Gods. Hobgoblins give regular recognition to the deities left to them after Maglubiyet’s conquest. Idols of Nomog-Geaya, as well as standards and flags with his image or symbol, receive a bow or salute at all times except emergencies. Bargrivyek’s peacemakers receive due deference regardless of rank or banner status. Of course, Maglubiyet’s call to conquest is always answered.\n\nSuffer nor Give Insult. As befits their warlike nature, hobgoblins believe that any insult demands a response. Suitably (and somewhat ironically), the outward politeness and civility that they demonstrate among each other enables them to avoid conflicts in daily life. This same form of “courtesy” is often extended to other races the hobgoblins have dealings with, much to the outsiders’ surprise. When such respect isn’t reciprocated, though, relations can swiftly deteriorate.\n\nReward Glorious Action. Hobgoblins never deny advancement in status to a banner that has earned it, nor do they withhold higher rank from a deserving individual. If a banner attains great glory in battle but is nearly destroyed, the handful of members who remain are welcomed into another banner, taking their banner’s name and colors along with them, and assuming places of leadership in the group.\n\nUphold the Legion. Hobgoblins care more for the survival of their legion than they do for others of their own kind. Two legions might battle over territory, resources, or power, or out of simple pride. Such a feud can continue over generations in an ongoing cycle of retribution. Each legion has a list of grievances against any others it knows about, and any legions meeting for the first time view each other with immediate hostility. Only a truly great warlord can force legions to work together as an army if Maglubiyet has not called forth a host.","isNoGenderName":true,"colorIndex":12,"selectionSkills":{},"isStandard":false,"noGenderNames":"","heightFeet":5,"maleNames":"","sizes":["Medium"],"lowerAge":18,"name":"Hobgoblin (Legacy)","subraces":[],"source":{"sourceType":"canon","book":"Volo's Guide to Monsters"},"is2024":false,"freeSkills":{},"newFeatures":[{"isCustom":false,"name":"Darkvision","customFeat":{"tags":"Darkvision#####Hardcoded Content#####Type: Feature","level":0,"isStandard":true,"featureDescription":"You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

Kenku suffer from a sinister reputation that is not wholly unearned, but they can prove to be valuable allies.\n\nAn Ancient Curse\n\nThe kenku once served a mysterious, powerful entity on another plane of existence. Some believe they were minions of Grazz’t, while others say that they were scouts and explorers for the Wind Dukes of Aaqa. Whatever the truth, according to legend, the kenku betrayed their master. Unable to resist the lure of a beautiful sparkling treasure, the kenku plotted to steal the item and escape to the Material Plane.\n\nUnfortunately for the kenku, their master discovered their plan before they could enact it. Enraged, the entity imposed three dreadful curses upon them. First, the kenku’s beloved wings withered and fell away from their bodies, leaving them bound to the earth. Second, because their ingenuity and skill had turned toward scheming against their patron, the spark of creativity was torn from their souls. Finally, to ensure that the kenku could never divulge any secrets, their master took away their voices. Once the entity was satisfied that they had been sufficiently punished, the kenku were set loose on the Material Plane.\n\nSince then, the kenku have wandered the world. They settle in places that accept them, usually bleak cities that have fallen on hard times and are overrun with crime.\n\nDreams of Flight\n\nAbove all else, kenku wish to regain their ability to fly. Every kenku is born with a desire to take to the air, and those who learn spellcasting do so in hope of mastering spells that will allow them to fly. Rumors of magic items such as flying carpets, brooms capable of flight, and similar objects provoke a great desire for the kenku to acquire the items for themselves.\n\nDespite their lack of wings, kenku love dwelling in towers and other tall structures. They seek out ruins that reach to the sky, though they lack the motivation and creativity to make repairs or fortify such places. Even so, their light weight and size allow them to dwell in rickety structures that would collapse beneath a human or an orc.\n\nSome thieves’ guilds use kenku as lookouts and messengers. The kenku dwell in the tallest buildings and towers the guild controls, allowing them to lurk in the highest levels and to keep watch on the city below.\n\nHopeless Plagiarists\n\nAs a result of their lack of creativity, kenku function comfortably as minions of a powerful master. Flock leaders enforce discipline and minimize conflicts, but they fail at effective planning or crafting long-term schemes.\n\nAlthough unable to speak in their own voices, kenku can perfectly mimic any sound they hear, from a half­ling’s voice to the noise of rocks clattering down a hillside. However, kenku cannot create new sounds and can communicate only by using sounds they have heard. Most kenku use a combination of overheard phrases and sound effects to convey their ideas and thoughts.\n\nBy the same token, kenku have no ability to invent new ideas or create new things. Kenku can copy existing items with exceptional skill, allowing them to become excellent artisans and scribes. They can copy books, make replicas of objects, and otherwise thrive in situations where they can produce large numbers of identical items. Few kenku find this work satisfying, since their quest for the freedom of flight makes them ill-suited to settle into a routine.\n\nIdeal Minions\n\nKenku gather in groups called flocks. A flock is led by the oldest and most experienced kenku with the widest store of knowledge to draw on, often called Master.\n\nAlthough kenku can’t create new things, they have a talent for learning and memorizing details. Thus, ambitious kenku can excel as superb spies and scouts. A kenku who learns of clever schemes and plans devised by other creatures can put them to use. The kenku lack the talent to improvise or alter a plan, but a wise Master sets multiple plans in motion at once, confident that underlings can follow orders to the letter.\n\nFor this reason, many kenku make an easy living serving as messengers, spies, and lookouts for thieves’ guilds, bandits, and other criminal cartels. A network of kenku can relay a bird call or similar noise across the city, alerting their allies to the approach of a guard patrol or signaling a prime opportunity for a robbery.\n\nSince kenku can precisely reproduce any sound, the messages they carry rarely suffer degradation or shifts in meaning. Human messengers might switch words or phrases and garble a message inadvertently, but the kenku produce perfect copies of whatever they hear.\n\nKenku Adventurers\n\nKenku adventurers are usually the survivors of a flock that has sustained heavy losses, or a rare kenku who has grown weary of a life of crime. These kenku are more ambitious and daring than their fellows. Others strike out on their own in search of the secrets of flight, to master magic, or to uncover the secret of their curse and find a method to break it.\n\nKenku adventurers, despite their relative independence, still have a tendency to seek out a companion to emulate and follow. A kenku loves to mimic the voice and words of its chosen companion.","is2024":false},{"newLanguages":[{"isCustom":false,"language":"Common"}],"heightInches":-32768,"femaleNames":"","maleNames":"","freePoints":[0,0,0,0,0,0],"subraces":[],"numSkillSelections":0,"heightFeet":-32768,"freeSkills":{},"isStandard":false,"raceDescription":"Some of the smallest draconic creatures in the multiverse, kobolds display their draconic ancestry in the glint of their scales and in their roars.

Tawny fur covers leonin bodies, and some grow thick manes ranging in shades from gold to black. While their hands prove as nimble as those of other humanoids, leonin have retractable feline claws, which they can extend instantly. This, along with their ability to produce bone-shaking roars, gives most leonin an air that readily shifts between regal and fearsome. Leonin often act with confidence, which can come off as imperiousness. While this can reassure their allies, it can also suggest defiance in the face of what they perceive as imposed authority or unworthy experts.\n\nQuick to Quarrel\n\nOther peoples often perceive leonin as quick to take offense, intolerant of criticism, or belligerent. The truth is that many leonin simply enjoy fighting, whether verbal or physical. They take pleasure in argument, wrestling, sparring, and even battle, enjoying the opportunity to exercise their minds and bodies. It follows, too, that leonin aren’t inclined to carry grudges. A warrior might react with sudden violence to an insult, but when the fight is over (and the leonin’s superiority proven), the insult is forgotten—along with the vanquished foe.\n\nPride and Self-Reliance\n\nFew leonin devote themselves to the service of the gods. Centuries ago, the leonin worshiped the same gods that humans do, but after many of their prides suffered depravities at the hands of the tyrant Agnomakhos, most leonin rejected the gods. It’s not that they deny the existence of deities; they merely see the gods as mercurial and ultimately unworthy of adoration. The Leonin and the Gods table suggests the range of attitudes that leonin might adopt toward the gods.\n\nLeonin rely on themselves and their prides. A pride is bound together by the experience of a shared challenge and, in particular, the sacred act of the hunt.

Their ties to the undead grant dhampirs a taste of a vampire’s deathless prowess in the form of increased speed, darkvision, and a life-draining bite.\n\nWith unique insights into the nature of the undead, many dhampirs become adventurers and monster hunters. Their reasons are often deeply personal. Some seek danger, imagining monsters as personifications of their own hungers. Others pursue revenge against whatever turned them into a dhampir. And still others embrace the solitude of the hunt, striving to distance themselves from those who’d tempt their hunger.\n\nDhampirs in the Domains of Dread\n\nWhen creating a dhampir, ask your DM if it makes sense for your character to have ties to one of the following Domains of Dread (detailed in chapter 3):\n\nBarovia. In the shadow of Castle Ravenloft, tales flourish of those who love or descend from vampires. You might have such a connection, but dread what would happen if others in your insular community found out.\n\nDarkon. The Kargat, this shattered domain’s secret police, supposedly know the secret of immortality. Perhaps you joined and advanced through their lesser ranks, known as the Kargatane, and were rewarded by being transformed into a dhampir.\n\nI’Cath. At night, the starving city of I’Cath is overrun by vampiric jiangshi (described in chapter 5). You were left with a cold hunger after an encounter with one of these unquiet ancestors.","selectionSkills":{},"movement":{"hover":-1,"fly":-1,"speed":-1,"burrow":-1,"climb":-1,"swim":-1},"freePoints":[0,0,0,0,0,0],"source":{"page":15,"book":"Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft","sourceType":"canon"}},"importRaceName":"Lineages"},{"importRaceName":"Lineages","name":"Hexblood","customSubrace":{"freeSkills":{},"subraceDescription":"Where wishing fails, ancient magic can offer a heart’s desire—at least, for a time. Hexbloods are individuals infused with eldritch magic, fey energy, or mysterious witchcraft. Some who enter into bargains with hags gain their deepest wishes but eventually find themselves transformed. These changes evidence a hag’s influence: ears that split in forked points, skin in lurid shades, long hair that regrows if cut, and an irremovable living crown. Along with these marks, hexbloods manifest hag-like traits, such as darkvision and a variety of magical methods to beguile the senses and avoid the same.\n\nWhile many hexbloods gain their lineage after making a deal with a hag, others reveal their nature as they age—particularly if a hag influenced them early in life or even before their birth. Many hexbloods turn to lives of adventure, seeking to discover the mysteries of their magic, to forge a connection with their fey natures, or to avoid a hag that obsesses over them.\n\nHeir of Hags\n\nOne way hags create more of their kind is through the creation of hexbloods. Every hexblood exhibits features suggestive of the hag whose magic inspires their powers. This includes an unusual crown, often called an eldercross or a witch’s turn. This living, garland-like part of a hexblood’s body extends from their temples and wraps behind the head, serving as a visible mark of the bargain between hag and hexblood, a debt owed, or a change to come.\n\nHexbloods in the Domains of Dread\n\nWhen creating a hexblood, consult with your DM to see if it’s appropriate to tie your origins to one of the following Domains of Dread (detailed in chapter 3):\n\nHazlan. The bizarre magic of this crumbling domain exposes the populace to supernatural forces, occasionally giving rise to hexbloods.\n\nKartakass. Whimsical witches make their homes in the forests of Kartakass. They eagerly grant the wishes of locals seeking grand fortunes for their children.\n\nTepest. Many of the children in the town of Viktal are hexbloods who exhibit their supernatural natures from a young age. Each youngster is considered a gift from the town’s patron deity, who is known as Mother.","newFeatures":[{"customFeat":{"level":0,"tags":"Added","featureDescription":"Fey are creatures of magic with a connection to nature.

They hum or chant in sonorous tones and move slowly or sit in perfect stillness. If provoked to action, loxodons are true terrors—bellowing with rage, trumpeting and flapping their ears. Their serene wisdom, fierce loyalty, and unwavering conviction are tremendous assets to their guilds.\n\nLumbering Giants\n\nLoxodons tower above most other humanoids, standing over 7 feet tall. They have the heads—trunks, tusks, ears, and faces—of elephants, and hulking bipedal bodies covered by thick, leathery skin. Each of their hands has four thick digits, and their feet are the flat-bottomed, oval-shaped feet of elephants.\n\nLike that of an elephant, a loxodon’s trunk is a useful appendage. In addition to providing a keen sense of smell, the trunk can be used to lift and carry even heavy objects. The trunk can be used to carry both food and liquid to the mouth and can even act as a snorkel.\n\nGifted Stoneworkers\n\nLoxodons are tireless, patient artisans with an unrivaled intuition about their craft. Although they make nurturing spiritual leaders, their gift for stonework is so ingrained that they are often at a loss when they try to impart that knowledge to others. Among the Selesnya, it primarily falls to loxodons to build the guild’s magnificent, cathedral-like arboretum structures.\n\nRelentlessly Loyal\n\nLoxodons believe in the value of community and life, and thus are most often found in the Selesnya Conclave. Some find fulfillment in the cause of order by joining the Orzhov Syndicate or the Azorius Senate.\n\nLoxodons believe that the members of a group have a responsibility to look out for each other. Once they have joined a guild or bonded with other individuals in any capacity, loxodons devote themselves to maintaining that bond. They coordinate their efforts and are often willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the group. They expect reciprocal loyalty and commitment from the other members of their communities and can be severe in their disappointment when their trust is betrayed.\n\nThe primary difference between loxodons who join different guilds is their sense of the size of the community they belong to. For loxodons in the Selesnya Conclave, their community is the world and all living beings in it—everything valuable, meant to live in harmony, and interdependent. For Azorius loxodons, community primarily means a society of different peoples who need adherence to law and order so they can function together. For those in the Orzhov Syndicate, community means the syndicate alone, with its interests taking priority over those of any other group.","isNoGenderName":false,"numSkillSelections":0,"isStandard":false,"maleNames":"","lowerAge":18,"sizes":["Medium"],"tags":"Added#####Type: Race\/Species","weightPounds":350,"name":"Loxodon","source":{"sourceType":"canon","book":"Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica"},"is2024":false,"higherAge":450,"newFeatures":[{"customFeat":{"tags":"Added#####Type: Race\/Species","type":"noLevelFeature","isStandard":false,"name":"Keen Smell","level":0,"newEffects":{"textboxInitialValue":"","textbox":false,"toggeable":false},"featureDescription":"Thanks to your sensitive trunk, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception), Wisdom (Survival), and Intelligence (Investigation) checks that involve smell.","source":{"book":"Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica","sourceType":"canon"}},"isCustom":true,"name":"Keen Smell"},{"isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"tags":"Added","type":"noLevelFeature","isStandard":false,"name":"Loxodon Serenity","level":0,"newEffects":{"textbox":false,"textboxInitialValue":"","toggeable":false},"featureDescription":"You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.","source":{"sourceType":"canon","book":"Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica"}},"name":"Loxodon Serenity"},{"isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"tags":"Added#####Type: Race\/Species","type":"noLevelFeature","isStandard":false,"name":"Natural Armor (AC12)","level":0,"newEffects":{"toggeable":false,"textboxInitialValue":"","armorClasses":[{"type":"unarmoredDefense","stats":{"doubles":[0,0,1,0,0,0],"integers":[0,0,0,0,0,0],"stats":{"constitution":true}},"level":0,"i1":12}],"textbox":false},"featureDescription":"You have thick, leathery skin.

They are as often shunned for their eccentricities as they are celebrated for them. Lumas are smaller than most birdfolk, and resemble either doves or pigeons. Many have ruffs of feathers that shine with unique iridescent colors, something which can be seen as either alluring or unusual. Most fledgling lumas approach social situations with hesitation, until a time when society inevitably labels them an outcast or a notable figure, and the individual naturally adapts to the role.\n\nTouched\n\nTo most, lumas seem perpetually disorganized and distracted, which has led to a belief that they are of low intelligence. In truth, lumas have a unique perception of the world. They are able to interpret information in an uncommon way, allowing them to see possibilities others cannot.\n\nThese inherent talents, sometimes dismissed as luck, can be improved upon with training and study. Pairing their natural gifts with magical education, powerful luma wizards and radical scholars have been at the forefront of magical innovation for some time in Humblewood.\n\nOf Two Worlds\n\nWhile most lumas find their peculiar nature to be a hindrance in society, some make use of their gifts to climb the social ladder. These individuals inspire curiosity and have an air of authority about them. This divide in social standing among lumas can make for curious and strained relationships among families and friends.\n\nOther lumas find it difficult to exist in the larger society of birdfolk cities. It is said that this is a main contributing factor for the close-knit, and exclusive luma districts in larger cities. Lumas tend to keep to themselves, preferring the company of those who understand them rather than those who pass judgement.","isNoGenderName":true,"numSkillSelections":0,"isStandard":false,"maleNames":"","sizes":["Small"],"tags":"Added#####Type: Race\/Species","lowerAge":20,"weightPounds":30,"name":"Lumas","source":{"sourceType":"homebrew","page":16,"customName":"Humblewood Campaign Setting "},"is2024":false,"higherAge":70,"newFeatures":[{"isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"featureDescription":"Whether by luck or a guiding presence, you always seem to find your way.

They are crafty, hearty, and tough, but their true strength lies in the potential they see when looking at the world around them. Mapachs have incredibly light hands and a great degree of fine motor control that doesn’t diminish with age. They are also adept at climbing and sneaking. This, combined with their love of trinkets, has earned them an undeserved reputation as thieves. While there are exceptions, most mapachs are quite good-natured, if a little eccentric.\n\nResilient Opportunists\n\nMapachs are adept at surviving tough woodland conditions, and at intuiting the right course of action when faced with a problem. They are also inveterate opportunists. Some may consider them brash, but mapachs know that opportunities rarely present themselves and are quick to act on them. Mapachs are alert and have a keen awareness of their surroundings. Only the truly foolhardy among them are taken in by obvious traps.\n\nCanny Craftspeople\n\nOne of the traits mapachs are most well-known for is their ability to find a use for just about anything. This knack for creating functional or useful items out of debris, junk, or on-hand materials is known as “scroungecraft,” and is a cultural staple among mapachs. This activity is considered an art form among mapachs, on par with the high art of other peoples. Scroungecrafting demonstrates creativity, ingenuity, and resourcefulness, but is misunderstood by outsiders who see it as primitive or crude. Genius ideas created by mapach hands frequently began as scroungecraft prototypes. Many who have built such interesting or unique creations achieve celebrity status among mapachs, going on to showcase their skills in loosely-organized scroungecraft fairs.\n\nHubs of Invention\n\nMapachs are often loners, but when they do establish communities with humblefolk or birdfolk, they have a habit of fostering innovation wherever they go. Mapach ingenuity was responsible for the contraption upon which Alderheart’s pulley system was based. The pulley system was so successful that birdfolk perches beyond Alderheart have adopted the technology.","isNoGenderName":true,"numSkillSelections":0,"isStandard":false,"maleNames":"","sizes":["Medium"],"tags":"Added#####Type: Race\/Species","lowerAge":8,"weightPounds":125,"name":"Mapach","source":{"sourceType":"homebrew","page":28,"customName":"Humblewood Campaign Setting "},"is2024":false,"higherAge":60,"newFeatures":[{"isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"featureDescription":"You have a climb speed of 20 feet.","source":{"customName":"Humblewood Campaign Setting ","page":28,"sourceType":"homebrew"},"isStandard":false,"level":0,"type":"noLevelFeature","name":"Expert Climbers","tags":"Added","newEffects":{"textbox":false,"toggeable":false,"textboxInitialValue":""}},"name":"Expert Climbers"},{"name":"Resilience","customFeat":{"featureDescription":"You have advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance against poison damage.","source":{"page":16,"sourceType":"homebrew","customName":"Humblewood Campaign Setting "},"isStandard":false,"level":0,"type":"noLevelFeature","name":"Resilience","tags":"Added","newEffects":{"textboxInitialValue":"","textbox":false,"resistances":[{"type":"resistance","level":0,"s1":"Poison","s2":""}],"toggeable":false}},"isCustom":true},{"name":"Scroungecraft","customFeat":{"featureDescription":"You are proficient with tinker’s tools. Additionally, you have the ability to construct crude but functional versions of common items using materials present in your surroundings. You may spend 10 minutes to craft these materials into any tool or piece of adventuring gear worth 30 gold pieces or less. The item will be completely functional, even capable of passing for a disguise (if you crafted an article of clothing). Tools, along with any other item that would logically break on its first use (caltrops, arrows), will become useless afterward. Scroungecrafted items will otherwise last 1 hour before falling apart.\n\nDepending on the materials available, a Game Master (GM) may rule that you cannot craft an item in this way. For example, a vial of acid might be easy to make if you happen to be near a nest of acidic beetle larvae, or bark can be bound into a makeshift flask, but it would be difficult to create a passable facsimile of silken robes from a pile of leaves.\n\nShould you have access to the proper materials, you can spend 8 hours converting an item you have scroungecrafted in this way into a permanent version, so long as you start this process before the item falls apart. Items crafted in such a way will function exactly as a normal version of the item, and if you have proficiency in the tools used to craft them, they can even look professionally-crafted. Otherwise, they retain a rather rough, cobbled-together appearance. You can also use scroungecraft to repair broken equipment, provided you have the materials on hand.

They are at home on the battlefield, willing to fight for their various causes.\n\nThey combine a burning fury in battle with keen tactics that make them excellent commanders as well as valuable shock troops.\n\nHorns and Hooves\n\nMinotaurs are barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling those of bulls. Their horns range in size from about 1 foot long to great, curling weapons easily three times that length. They often ornament their horns with metal rings or sheathe them in metal to protect them from damage.\n\nManes of shaggy fur extend down minotaurs’ necks and powerful backs, and males have long tufts of hair on their chins and cheeks. Their legs end in heavy, cloven hooves. Minotaurs are born with long, tufted tails, but minotaurs of the Ordruun clan (and some others) have their tails docked as part of a coming-of-age ceremony; they find the heavy armor of the Boros legion much more comfortable without a long tail in the way.\n\nStrength and Zeal\n\nMinotaurs are zealous and love battle. They are found among the Gruul Clans, but the minotaurs of the Ordruun family line, long associated with the Boros Legion, are much better known and respected. Boros minotaurs choose the precision of the legion over the fury of the pack.\n\nMinotaurs tend to vent their outrage through violence, but they aren’t generally quick to anger. They are passionate, loving their friends and partners fiercely, and they laugh loud and long at good jokes.\n\nFamily and Guild\n\nMinotaur legends describe a small pantheon of heroes—perhaps they were once thought of as gods—who established the minotaurs’ place in the world. Every minotaur in Ravnica claims descent from one of these heroes. The Ordruun line is the most prominent, with thousands of members descended from an ancient hero who is said to have taught minotaurs the arts of war. Other important family lines include the Kharran line (primarily associated with the Gruul Scab clan), the Drendaa line (found scattered among the Gruul Clans), and the Tazgral line (divided between the Boros and the Gruul, with a significant number in the Rakdos as well).\n\nSince each family line has so many members, minotaurs don’t usually find it helpful to connect the name of the line to their personal names; even though Commander Grozdan of the Boros Legion’s Kamen Fortress is a prominent member of the Ordruun line, he would never call himself Grozdan Ordruun the way a human would."},{"subraces":[],"freeSkills":{},"movement":{"burrow":-1,"climb":-1,"hover":-1,"speed":30,"fly":-1,"swim":-1},"heightInches":-32768,"isStandard":false,"name":"Orc","tags":"Added#####Type: Race\/Species","freePoints":[0,0,0,0,0,0],"colorIndex":0,"selectionSkills":{},"maleNames":"","newLanguages":[{"language":"Common","isCustom":false}],"femaleNames":"","lowerAge":0,"isNoGenderName":false,"numSkillSelections":0,"heightFeet":-32768,"sizes":["Medium"],"higherAge":0,"weightPounds":-32768,"is2024":false,"source":{"page":28,"sourceType":"canon","book":"Monsters of the Multiverse"},"noGenderNames":"","newFeatures":[{"customFeat":{"type":"noLevelFeature","featureDescription":"When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.

Resembling small hawks, eagles, and other birds of prey, they have sharp talons and agile builds that help them effortlessly glide through the canopy. These birdfolk are swift and strong with an uncanny knack for tracking. They are rarely prey, and are quick to turn the tables when finding themselves hunted.\n\nPerceptive Awareness\n\nGiven their heightened senses, often raptors appear to be distracted or deep in thought. In reality, they are processing the wealth of sensory information they receive from their particularly keen eyes and sensitive ears. While many folk are only ever aware of what goes on directly around them, raptors have an extremely wide field of awareness.\n\nRaptors are adept at living off the land. They are skilled hunters, usually leading the harvesting of meat and skins for their perches.

They are more likely to adopt a transient lifestyle, moving from perch to perch, or to simply live in the vast forests of the Wood itself.\n\nThough typically quiet, raptors are not averse to forming relationships with other birdfolk. Despite their reserved nature, raptors value personal bonds more highly than societal or even familial ties."},{"isNoGenderName":true,"colorIndex":0,"freeSkills":{},"noGenderNames":"","maleNames":"","higherAge":0,"subraces":[],"movement":{"burrow":-1,"climb":-1,"hover":-1,"speed":35,"fly":-1,"swim":-1},"femaleNames":"","selectionSkills":{},"numSkillSelections":0,"weightPounds":-32768,"heightFeet":-32768,"freePoints":[0,0,0,0,0,0],"newLanguages":[{"isCustom":false,"language":"Common"}],"newFeatures":[{"name":"Choose Ability Scores (+2,+1)","customFeat":{"featureDescription":"When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.

Most satyrs are driven by simple desires, to see the world and to sample its every pleasure.\n\nWhile their spontaneity and whimsy sometimes put them at odds with more stoic peoples, satyrs rarely let the moodiness of others hinder their own happiness.\n\nLife is a blessing from the gods, after all, and the proper response to such a gift, as far as most satyrs are concerned, is to accept it with relish.\n\nBorn of the Wild\n\nIn their physical forms, satyrs embody a fusion of humanoid civilization with the freedom of wild beasts. Generally, they look similar to humans, with a range of builds and features. But their goatlike horns, pointed ears, and furred lower bodies sharply distinguish them. Satyrs’ solid horns connect to their heads at the base of their skulls, while their legs end in sturdy hooves. Thick fur covers their bodies from the waist down, shorter at the waist and longer below the knees. Short, soft hair grows down their neck and spine, along their shoulders, and on their forearms.\n\nEmbracing Life\n\nMost satyrs believe that the other peoples of Theros are woefully burdened with the plague of seriousness. Satyrs scoff at the efforts of polis-builders with their laws and right angles, and they poke fun at philosophers with their endless theories and interminable discourse. Satyrs feel that life is to be lived and experienced with all the senses. Satyrs see the world and everything in it as a book of delights, and they want to explore every page. See chapter 3 for more details on the satyr homeland, the Skola Vale.\n\nThe Art of the Revel\n\nThe humans of the poleis generally think of satyrs’ revels as raucous bacchanals, where anything and everything might happen. This picture isn’t wrong, but it’s incomplete: there’s more to a revel than debauchery. For satyrs, revelry is a way of life. It’s the delight in small things: the song of a bird, a warm breeze, the smell of a tasty pie, relaxing by a river in the sunshine. Life freely offers these gifts, and for a satyr, they are more valuable than gold or glory. To revel means to forget the constraints of time, to let go of the future and past, and to be wholly in the present moment. For satyrs, encountering life with all the senses honors the gods, and—most importantly—it feels really good. Driven by instinct and intuition, most satyrs prove unpredictable, following their sense of wonder wherever it leads.\n\nVery Odd Indeed\n\nSatyrs are known for their eccentricities. Some people spend too much time worrying over why satyrs behave as they do. But satyrs themselves simply are as they are, feeling no need to understand what drives them, much less explain it to others. The Satyr Eccentricities table suggests a few tastes or proclivities your satyr character might possess"},{"heightInches":-32768,"raceDescription":"Sea elves fell in love with the wild beauty of the ocean in the earliest days of the multiverse.

Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they can’t fully change shape, they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features — a state they call shifting. Each shifter walks on the knife’s edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization?\n\nThe Beast Within\n\nEarly in childhood, a shifter forms a bond with a beast within, a totemic force that shapes their body and mind. Some shifters believe that these spirits are independent entities, and they may speak of Bear or Wolf as ancestors or guides. Most just see the beast within as a formidable expression of their inner nature, something that emerges as the shifter’s personality takes shape. The beast within is a pool of powerful instincts, and its influence is revealed by a shifter’s personality: a feline shifter may be cool and distant, driven by predatory instincts, while a shifter with a lupine spirit might be drawn to find and protect a pack. When a shifter fully embraces this beast within they physically transform for a short time.\n\nA shifter’s beast within is reflected by the shifter’s subrace. Four subraces are especially common:\n\nBeasthide often signifies the bear or boar: stoic, stubborn, and thick-skinned.\nLongtooth shifters typically have lupine traits and prefer to run with a pack.\nSwiftstride are often predatory and feline, but a swiftstride could also be a cunning rat who darts through the shadows.\nWildhunt shifters are born from any creature that tracks its prey.\nWhile the beast within certainly has a physical impact on a shifter, it has a spiritual and psychological effect, as well. Two beasthide shifters share the same special ability, but if one has the aspect of the boar and the other is more like a bear, they’ll be quite different in personality. With any shifter, identifying the beast within is a crucial part of understanding the character.\n\nSimilar and Diverse\n\nShifters are similar to humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes, flat noses, and pointed ears; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies.\n\nThe traits of the beast within affect a shifter’s appearance as well. A swiftstride shifter may have catlike eyes and delicate build, while a beasthide shifter might be a massive brute built like a bear. While a shifter’s appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral.\n\nThe Journey Yet to Come\n\nShifters have a strong presence in the Eldeen Reaches but can be found in rural areas across Khorvaire, where they often live among humans. While they form powerful bonds to friends and kin, shifters place great value on self-reliance and freedom. It’s a shifter proverb to “always be prepared for the journey yet to come,” and most shifters strive to be ready for change or opportunity.\n\nShifters have a natural inclination toward classes with a primal connection. A shifter barbarian draws their rage from the beast within. A shifter ranger indulges their urge to wander and hunt. A shifter rogue harnesses their own predatory instincts. But shifters can pursue any path or faith.","subraces":[{"name":"Beasthide","isCustom":true,"customSubrace":{"source":{"page":33,"book":"Eberron : Rising from the Last War","sourceType":"canon"},"tags":"Added","name":"Beasthide","subraceDescription":"Stoic and solid, a beasthide shifter draws strength and stability from the beast within.

They make mighty warriors, and whether defending their perch or braving the Wood itself, strigs never shy away from a fight.\n\nStrig culture is largely based on principles of strength and endurance above all, but not necessarily for the purposes of combat. Protecting and providing for others in hard times is considered just as impressive, if not more so, than winning a fight.\n\nWoodland Survivors\n\nStrigs, more than any of the other birdfolk race, are most at home in the wild. Their mottled feather patterns, though not as bright or beautiful as others, allow them to easily hide in the forest. Due to this inherent advantage, along with their speed and power, strigs make excellent hunters and rangers.\n\nStrigs prefer the relative simplicity of the forest to the machinations of society and politics. Despite these individualistic tendencies, they are capable of forming familial and community bonds that transcend a permanent or single physical home.","weightPounds":110,"numSkillSelections":0,"isStandard":false,"freePoints":[2,0,0,0,0,0],"source":{"customName":"Humblewood Campaign Setting ","page":20,"sourceType":"homebrew"},"maleNames":"","heightInches":1,"sizes":["Medium"],"tags":"Added#####Type: Race\/Species","heightFeet":5,"lowerAge":15,"higherAge":80,"femaleNames":""},{"colorIndex":0,"movement":{"swim":-1,"fly":-1,"speed":30,"climb":30,"hover":-1,"burrow":-1},"selectionSkills":{},"newLanguages":[{"language":"Common","isCustom":false}],"isNoGenderName":true,"noGenderNames":"","name":"Tabaxi","subraces":[],"newFeatures":[{"customFeat":{"type":"noLevelFeature","name":"Cat's Claws","featureDescription":"You have claws that you can use to make unarmed strikes.

Ultimate travelers, the inquisitive tabaxi rarely stay in one place for long. Their innate nature pushes them to leave no secrets uncovered, no treasures or legends lost.\n\nWandering Outcasts\n\nMost tabaxi remain in their distant homeland, content to dwell in small, tight clans. These tabaxi hunt for food, craft goods, and largely keep to themselves.\n\nHowever, not all tabaxi are satisfied with such a life. The Cat Lord, the divine figure responsible for the creation of the tabaxi, gifts each of his children with one specific feline trait. Those tabaxi gifted with curiosity are compelled to wander far and wide. They seek out stories, artifacts, and lore. Those who survive this period of wanderlust return home in their elder years to share news of the outside world. In this manner, the tabaxi remain isolated but never ignorant of the world beyond their home.\n\nBarterers of Lore\n\nTabaxi treasure knowledge rather than material things. A chest filled with gold coins might be useful to buy food or a coil of rope, but it’s not intrinsically interesting. In the tabaxi’s eyes, gathering wealth is like packing rations for a long trip. It’s important to survive in the world, but not worth fussing over.\n\nInstead, tabaxi value knowledge and new experiences. Their ears perk up in a busy tavern, and they tease out stories with offers of food, drink, and coin. Tabaxi might walk away with empty purses, but they mull over the stories and rumors they collected like a miser counting coins.\n\nAlthough material wealth holds little attraction for the tabaxi, they have an insatiable desire to find and inspect ancient relics, magical items, and other rare objects. Aside from the power such items might confer, a tabaxi takes great joy in unraveling the stories behind their creation and the history of their use.\n\nFleeting Fancies\n\nWandering tabaxi are mercurial creatures, trading one obsession or passion for the next as the whim strikes. A tabaxi’s desire burns bright, but once met it disappears to be replaced with a new obsession. Objects remain intriguing only as long as they still hold secrets.\n\nA tabaxi rogue could happily spend months plotting to steal a strange gem from a noble, only to trade it for passage on a ship or a week’s lodging after stealing it. The tabaxi might take extensive notes or memorize every facet of the gem before passing it on, but the gem holds no more allure once its secrets and nature have been laid bare.\n\nTinkers and Minstrels\n\nCuriosity drives most of the tabaxi found outside their homeland, but not all of them become adventurers. Tabaxi who seek a safer path to satisfy their obsessions become wandering tinkers and minstrels.\n\nThese tabaxi work in small troupes, usually consisting of an elder, more experienced tabaxi who guides up to four young ones learning their way in the world. They travel in small, colorful wagons, moving from settlement to settlement. When they arrive, they set up a small stage in a public square where they sing, play instruments, tell stories, and offer exotic goods in trade for items that spark their interest. Tabaxi reluctantly accept gold, but they much prefer interesting objects or pieces of lore as payment.\n\nThese wanderers keep to civilized realms, preferring to bargain instead of pursuing more dangerous methods of sating their curiosity. However, they aren’t above a little discreet theft to get their claws on a particularly interesting item when an owner refuses to sell or trade it.","weightPounds":-32768,"numSkillSelections":0,"isStandard":false,"freePoints":[0,2,0,0,0,1],"source":{"sourceType":"canon","book":"Volo's Guide to Monsters"},"maleNames":"","heightInches":-32768,"sizes":["Medium"],"tags":"Added#####Legacy#####Type: Race\/Species","heightFeet":-32768,"lowerAge":18,"higherAge":80,"femaleNames":""},{"numSkillSelections":0,"tags":"Added#####Type: Race\/Species","colorIndex":20,"femaleNames":"","is2024":false,"maleNames":"","movement":{"speed":30,"fly":-1,"swim":-1,"climb":-1,"hover":-1,"burrow":-1},"sizes":["Medium"],"freeSkills":{"arcana":true},"weightPounds":-32768,"isNoGenderName":true,"subraces":[],"newLanguages":[],"newFeatures":[{"name":"Arcane Origin","isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"type":"noLevelFeature","name":"Arcane Origin","featureDescription":"You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill.","isStandard":false,"tags":"Added","level":0,"source":{"customName":"Grim Hollow","sourceType":"homebrew"},"newEffects":{"textboxInitialValue":"","toggeable":false,"textbox":false}}},{"name":"Choose Two Languages","isCustom":false,"customFeat":{"featureDescription":"Choose to learn two languages of your choice.","tags":"Hardcoded Content#####Type: Feature","name":"Choose Two Languages","isStandard":true,"level":0,"type":"noLevelFeature"}},{"name":"Fade Away","isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"featureDescription":"On your turn, as an action, you can fade from the Material Realm and disappear into the ethereal plane.

The Great College quickly became a lodestone for mages of every stripe from across the empire, and for a brief moment there existed a golden age of magic.\n\nThat dream came crashing down one night when the founding mages of Ulmyr’s Gate attempted a massive conjuration ritual intended to part the veil and create a permanent portal to the Ethereal Plane. It didn’t work. Instead their magic caused a massive rift in the very fabric of reality, and in an instant the entire city tipped into the void between worlds. The entire city was presumed dead, the Arcanist Inquisition railed against the hubris of those tampering in things man was not meant to know, and life in the Empire moved on.\n\nYears later, stories surfaced of strange people being sighted in the region where Ulmyr’s Gate once stood. These people seemed oddly blurred or indistinct, and some reports said they vanished right in front of witnesses’ eyes.

Tortles are born near sandy coastlines, but as soon as they’re able to walk on two legs, they become nomad survivalists eager to explore the wilderness, experience its many wonders, put their skills to the test, and make new acquaintances.\n\nLife of a Tortle\n\nA tortle hatches from a thick-shelled egg and spends the first few weeks of its life crawling on all fours. Its parents, old and near death, spend what little time they have left telling stories to their offspring. Within a year, the young tortle becomes an orphan, though not before it learns to speak and to survive on its own.\n\nA young tortle and its siblings inherit whatever tools, weapons, and gifts their parents left behind. Each young tortle is expected to fend for itself. It leaves the place of its birth and finds its own corner of the wilderness in which to hunt, catch fish, and get by. With each passing year, a tortle hones its survival skills. It forms friendships with its neighbors while also respecting their privacy. At some point, a tortle feels an almost overwhelming urge to venture far away from home and see more of the world. It gathers up its possessions and heads into the wilderness, returning months or years later with stories of its exploits and new skills.\n\nWhen a tortle nears the end of its natural lifespan, it seeks out a mate and procreates. Tortles lay their eggs (numbering as few as one or as many as a dozen) in a fortified compound enclosed by stone walls that are easily defensible. If no such compound exists, they build one. The parents spend the remainder of their lives guarding the compound, defending their offspring, and sharing a lifetime of knowledge before they die. When the children are old enough to leave the compound, they pick up whatever weapons and tools their parents left behind and set out on their own.\n\nBeliefs\n\nTortles don’t have their own pantheon of gods, but they often worship the gods of other races. It’s not unusual for a tortle to hear stories or legends related to a god and choose to worship that deity. In the Forgotten Realms, tortles are especially fond of Eldath, Gond, Lathander, Savras, Selûne, and Tymora. In the Greyhawk setting, they gravitate toward Celestian, Fharlanghn, Pelor, Pholtus, and St. Cuthbert. Tortles are often drawn to the Gods of Good in Dragonlance and the Sovereign Host in Eberron. Among the nonhuman deities, Moradin and Yondalla relate to tortles most of all.\n\nTortles believe that night and day watch over them and other creatures. The moon is the eye of night that watches over them in darkness, and the sun is the equally vigilant eye of day. Tortles feel most at peace when one or both of these “eyes” are looking down on them. They become more nervous and uneasy when neither orb is visible in the sky. Tortles tend to be most uncomfortable underground, where neither the sun nor the moon is visible to them.\n\nBlessed are the days when both the sun and moon are visible in the sky at the same time. Tortles often choose such days to leave their homes and begin a wilderness expedition, or perform some other task they know to be dangerous.\n\nAdventurers at Heart\n\nTortles have a saying: “We wear our homes on our backs.” The shells they carry around provide all the shelter they require. Consequently, tortles don’t feel the need to root themselves in one place for too long. A tortle settlement is primarily used as a kind of moot, where tortles can socialize with one another, share useful information, and trade with strangers in the safety of greater numbers. Tortles don’t regard these settlements as places worth defending with their lives, and they will abandon a settlement when it no longer serves their needs.\n\nMost tortles like to see how other creatures live and discover new customs and new ways of doing things. The urge to procreate doesn’t kick in until the end of a tortle’s life, and a tortle can spend decades away from its native land without feeling homesick. Tortles embrace a simple view of the world. It is a place of wonder, and tortles see beauty in the ordinary. They live for the chance to hear a soft wind blowing through palm trees, to watch a frog croaking on a lily pad, or to stand in a crowded human marketplace.\n\nTortles like to learn new skills. They craft their own tools and weapons, and they are good at building structures and fortifications. They marvel at the works of other civilized creatures, humans in particular, and can lose themselves for years in a city, studying its architectural wonders and learning skills they can put to use when building forts to contain their offspring.\n\nAlthough they spend a considerable portion of their lives in isolation, tortles are social creatures that like to form meaningful friendships. They have no inbred animus toward people of other races. In fact, a tortle will often seek out friendships with non tortles to learn new customs and new points of view."},{"is2024":false,"lowerAge":0,"numSkillSelections":0,"isNoGenderName":false,"subraces":[],"newLanguages":[{"isCustom":false,"language":"Common"}],"heightFeet":-32768,"freeSkills":{},"movement":{"speed":30,"burrow":-1,"fly":-1,"climb":-1,"hover":-1,"swim":30},"noGenderNames":"","raceDescription":"Originally from the Elemental Plane of Water, many tritons entered the Material Plane centuries ago in response to the growing threat of evil elementals.

Long-established guardians of the deep ocean floor, in recent years the noble tritons have become increasingly active in the world above.\n\nAquatic Crusaders\n\nCenturies ago, tritons entered the world in response to the growing threat of evil elementals. Tritons waged many wars against their enemies on the Plane of Water, driving them into the Darkened Depths where they escaped into the crushing pressure and utter darkness. In time, the tritons noticed that their ancient elemental foes had grown quiet. Expeditions to the depths revealed that krakens, sahuagin, and far worse foes had fled the Plane of Water for the Material Plane.\n\nThe tritons, driven by a sense of duty and responsibility, would not allow their foes to escape so easily. A great conclave of tritons chose volunteers skilled in weapons and magic as part of an expeditionary force to enter the Material Plane and seek out their enemies.\n\nThose tritons spread across the world’s oceans and established protectorates to watch over deep sea trenches, portals, undersea caves, and other locations where their enemies might lurk. They defeated their foes when they found them and drove the rest into hiding.\n\nWith their foes banished to the deepest reaches of the sea, tritons settled in to watch for any sign of their return. Over time, the tritons extended their stewardship over the sea floor from their initial settlements and built outposts to create trade with other races. Despite this expansion, few folk know of them. Their settlements are so remote even merfolk and sea elves rarely encounter them.\n\nHaughty Nobles\n\nAs a result of their isolation and limited understanding of the Material Plane, tritons can come across as haughty and arrogant. They see themselves as caretakers of the sea, and they expect other creatures to pay them deep respect, if not complete deference.\n\nThis attitude might grate on others, but it arises from a seed of truth. Few know of the tritons’ great victories over dreadful undersea threats. The tritons make little allowance for such ignorance and are delighted to expound upon the great debt others owe them.\n\nTritons also have a tendency to emerge from their isolation under the assumption that other folk will welcome them as respected allies and mentors. Again, distance drives much of this attitude. The tritons’ limited view of the world leaves them ignorant of the kingdoms, wars, and other struggles of the surface world. Tritons readily see such concerns as minor events, a sideshow to the tritons’ role as the world’s true protectors.\n\nStaunch Champions\n\nDespite their off-putting manners, tritons are benevolent creatures at heart, convinced that other civilized races deserve their protection. Their attitude might grate, but when pirate fleets prowl the waves or a kraken awakens from its slumber, they are among the first to take up arms to protect others.\n\nTritons readily sacrifice themselves for the common good. They will fight and die for humans, merfolk, and other creatures without question. Their self-absorbed nature makes them overlook the history of other creatures, but they also endure a sense of guilt over allowing the evils of the Plane of Water to enter the Material Plane and threaten its inhabitants. The tritons believe they owe a debt of honor to the world, and they will fight and die to pay it.\n\nAt times their fervor and ignorance of the world can lead them astray. Tritons encountering other creatures for the first time can underestimate them, leaving the tritons vulnerable to deception. With their strong martial tradition, tritons can sometimes be too eager to leap into a fight.\n\nStrangers to the Surface\n\nGiven their isolation, most tritons have never been to the surface world. They struggle with the idea that they can’t easily move up and down out of water, and the changing of the seasons mystifies them.\n\nTritons also find the variety of social institutions, kingdoms, and other customs bewildering. For all their proud culture, they remain innocent of the surface world. The typical triton protectorate is tightly regimented, organized, and unified around a common cause. A triton on the surface becomes easily confused by the bewildering array of alliances, rivalries, and petty grievances that prevent the surface folk from truly unifying.\n\nAt its worst, a triton’s arrogance compounds the tendency for the triton not to understand the ways of the surface world. It’s easy for a triton to blame baffling social practices on what the triton perceives as the barbarism, weakness, or cowardice of surface folk.","isStandard":false,"femaleNames":"Aryn#####Belthyn#####Duthyn#####Feloren#####Otanyn#####Shalryn#####Vlaryn#####Wolyn","tags":"Added#####Legacy#####Type: Race\/Species","selectionSkills":{},"higherAge":200,"sizes":["Medium"],"source":{"book":"Volo's Guide to Monsters","sourceType":"canon"},"maleNames":"Corus#####Delnis#####Jhimas#####Keros#####Molos#####Nalos#####Vodos#####Zunis","colorIndex":12,"name":"Triton (Legacy)","freePoints":[1,0,1,0,0,1],"newFeatures":[{"name":"Darkvision","isCustom":false,"customFeat":{"tags":"Darkvision#####Hardcoded Content#####Type: Feature","isStandard":true,"name":"Darkvision","level":0,"featureDescription":"You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

Descended and transformed from a large clan of goblins and hobgoblins, those who became the verdan were simply living their lives, doing goblinoid things. But then passing through the shadow of That-Which-Endures changed them forever. Now the newest race to call Faerûn home, the verdan do their best to find their way in an unfamiliar world.\n\nCreated by Chaos\n\nWhen the power of That-Which-Endures mutated the verdan, their skin was turned the color of jade and their blood began to flow black. Their ears grew pointed, and they gained a limited form of telepathy — but at the cost of forgetting their history. The underground homes of the goblins were places of terror to the new creatures those goblins became, and the verdan quickly fled to the surface and into the sunlight.\n\nWhen they arrived in the new lands of the surface, the verdan found that they were often mistaken for smaller, green-skinned half-elves. Attracting curiosity but no real questions, they have thus been able to make their way reasonably freely in the world.\n\nOngoing Mutations\n\nBecause the verdan have not dwelled long in the world, they are still discovering new things about themselves. Chief among these discoveries is that their physical forms change as they age, signifying that the mutative power of That-Which-Endures is not done with them. The first verdan emerged from the Underdark as creatures of goblin stature. But they soon learned that their kind were fated to eventually undergo a dramatic, painful, and random growth spurt that sees them transformed to hobgoblin size over a period of days.\n\nAt the same time, many verdan undergo changes in coloring as they age. Male verdan typically have little to no hair, while females sport shocks of wiry hair that they try to tame in a variety of styles. But the color of any verdan’s hair, skin, and eyes can transform from their original jade tones to pale white, deep ebon, or any other shade in between. A verdan’s ears also undergo numerous spontaneous alterations over their lifetime, from the typical range of point and peak seen among the elves, to huge ears that sweep back from the head like wings, and which are often pierced behind the head with a single ring to keep them from flapping about.\n\nChanges in gender are also a known and accepted part of verdan life. These fluid aspects of form and identity are seen as blessings, allowing an individual to experience more of the world and grow in empathy and understanding. There is no pattern to any verdan’s mutations, as verdan from the same family can shift in drastically different ways. The verdan assign no cultural or biological relevance to any particular coloration, physical features, or gender.\n\nCultural Chameleons\n\nThe clan homes of the Underdark goblinoids who became the verdan covered an enormous area. As the verdan fled to the surface world, they emerged in culturally diverse locations. Some found themselves near dwarven strongholds, others near elven enclaves, and others near the widespread human settlements of Faerûn.\n\nWithout a cultural identity or memory of their own, the verdan quickly adopted the cultural practices of the areas into which they migrated. Still, a sense of not truly belonging is felt even by verdan who have been welcomed into other cultures. They are often stricken with wanderlust, keeping their possessions limited and easily portable. It is not unusual to see individual verdan or whole families trooping along the roads of the world with their tents and belongings strapped to their backs.\n\nEven when they are happily steeped in a culture, the verdan remain on the lookout for oppression and curtailment of freedoms. They understand the need for laws that protect, but they rail against laws that restrict and oppress — especially those designed to protect the power and wealth of the elite. When living among enlightened folk, verdan are still the first to speak out against cultural restraints on individuals, particularly those based on physical characteristics such as gender, race, or appearance.\n\nWide-Eyed and Curious\n\nVerdan are hungry to undertake new challenges and absorb new experiences. When they meet other verdan who have traveled to different parts of the world, they drop everything to spend as long as possible sharing stories and observations from their respective travels. However, their inexperience in the world and their racial amnesia sometimes lends the verdan a kind of innocence that works against them. Some are credulous and easily fooled by hucksters, but most verdan have an intuition bred by empathy that helps them eventually sort out those who are sincere from those who are not.","isStandard":false,"femaleNames":"","tags":"Added#####Type: Race\/Species","selectionSkills":{},"higherAge":200,"sizes":["Small"],"source":{"book":"Acquisitions Incorporated","page":72,"sourceType":"canon"},"maleNames":"","colorIndex":16,"name":"Verdan","freePoints":[0,0,1,0,0,2],"newFeatures":[{"isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"name":"Black Blood Healing","isStandard":false,"featureDescription":"The black blood that is a sign of your people’s connection to That-Which-Endures boosts your natural healing.

One of the least understood and most often vilified humblefolk in the Wood, vulpins have earned a bad reputation that isn’t entirely deserved. Much of this stems from the fact that vulpins are ambitious. Sometimes their drive to succeed can make it difficult for them to empathize with others. Vulpins feel just as deeply as other folk of the Wood, but they possess a keen survival instinct which sometimes causes them to take courses of action that are selfish. Moreover, they are sharp and savvy, possessing an uncanny force of personality that allows them to easily sway the trust of others. In the right situations, vulpins can be true friends, and in the wrong ones, deadly enemies.\n\nArtful and Cunning\n\nVulpins are naturally intelligent, rivalled only by corvums. However, where corvums are studious, vulpins are more creative. They enjoy the arts and the pursuit of leisure. Some devote their lives to mastering an art form; learning sculpture, poetry, or refined swordplay. Even though vulpins come from every walk of life, they also have a reputation for being snobbish and looking down on others.\n\nAll vulpins have a natural connection to the magic of the Wood, though they channel it in specialized ways. The right look from a vulpin can bewitch or terrify, and vulpins who are truly skilled can command an entire room through sheer force of presence.\n\nProdigious Predators\n\nBefore the Humblefolk Treaty was signed, vulpins controlled a large part of the Wood outside the influence of the birdfolk, and bands of vulpin raiders provided their own kin with a wealth of plundered goods at the expense of birdfolk and other humblefolk alike. Those days are long since gone, but the memory of the sinister vulpin has yet to fade from the minds of the humblefolk, who endured great suffering at their hands.\n\nA few vulpins have attempted to change public opinion, but the majority are unconcerned with their notoriety. Vulpins learn from a young age that they are of two natures: the sophisticated and the savage. While sophistication and elegance are generally preferred, it is considered common sense that vulpins should know when to keep their fangs hidden and when to bear them.","newLanguages":[{"isCustom":true,"customLanguage":{"additionalInformation":"","name":"Vulpin","source":{"page":30,"customName":"Humblewood Campaign Setting ","sourceType":"homebrew"},"tags":"Added","isStandard":false},"language":"Vulpin"},{"isCustom":true,"customLanguage":{"additionalInformation":"","name":"Birdfolk","source":{"customName":"Humblewood Campaign Setting ","sourceType":"homebrew"},"tags":"Added","isStandard":false},"language":"Birdfolk"},{"isCustom":false,"language":"Common"}],"freePoints":[0,0,0,2,0,1]},{"freePoints":[0,0,2,0,0,0],"isStandard":false,"subraces":[],"newFeatures":[{"isCustom":true,"name":"Constructed Resilience","customFeat":{"name":"Constructed Resilience","isStandard":false,"level":0,"featureDescription":"You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits:\n\n* You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.\n\n* You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.\n\n* You are immune to disease.\n\n* You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep.","tags":"Added","newEffects":{"textbox":false,"textboxInitialValue":"","toggeable":false,"resistances":[{"type":"conditionImmunity","s2":"Diseased","s1":"","level":0},{"type":"resistance","s2":"","s1":"Poison","level":0}]},"source":{"book":"Eberron : Rising from the Last War","page":35,"sourceType":"canon"},"type":"noLevelFeature"}},{"isCustom":true,"name":"Integrated Profession","customFeat":{"name":"Integrated Profession","isStandard":false,"featureDescription":"Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armor:\n\n* You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.\n\n* You can don only armor with which you  have proficiency.

While the first warforged were mindless automatons, House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced sapient soldiers, giving rise to what some have only grudgingly accepted as a new species. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning.\n\nLiving Steel and Stone\n\nWarforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed.\n\nAlthough they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the Medicine skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids.\n\nWarforged Personality\n\nThe warforged were built to serve and to fight. For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Thronehold gave them freedom, but many still struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures who created them.\n\nThe typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose — such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land — and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.\n\nThe typical warforged has a sexless body shape. Some warforged ignore the concept of gender entirely, while others adopt a gender identity.\n\nThe more a warforged develops its individuality, the more likely it is to modify its body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of its face, limbs, and plating.","is2024":false,"newLanguages":[{"isCustom":false,"language":"Common"}]},{"newLanguages":[{"isCustom":false,"language":"Common"}],"isStandard":false,"subraces":[],"newFeatures":[{"isCustom":true,"customFeat":{"type":"noLevelFeature","newEffects":{"textboxInitialValue":"","textbox":false,"toggeable":false,"resistances":[{"s2":"","s1":"Acid","type":"resistance","level":0}]},"name":"Acid Resistance","featureDescription":"You have resistance to acid damage.","isStandard":false,"source":{"book":"Monsters of the Multiverse","page":17,"sourceType":"canon"},"level":0,"tags":"Added"},"name":"Acid Resistance"},{"isCustom":true,"name":"Amphibious","customFeat":{"type":"noLevelFeature","newEffects":{"toggeable":false,"textboxInitialValue":"","textbox":false},"name":"Amphibious","featureDescription":"You can breathe air and water","isStandard":false,"source":{"sourceType":"canon","page":35,"book":"Monsters of the Multiverse"},"level":0,"tags":"Added"}},{"isCustom":true,"name":"Choose Ability Scores (+2,+1)","customFeat":{"level":0,"name":"Choose Ability Scores (+2,+1)","isStandard":false,"newEffects":{"textboxInitialValue":"","textbox":false,"toggeable":false,"abilityScores":[{"stats":{"integers":[0,0,0,0,0,0],"doubles":[0,0,0,0,0,0],"stats":{"charisma":true,"dexterity":true,"intelligence":true,"constitution":true,"wisdom":true,"strength":true}},"i1":3,"type":"distributePoints","level":0}]},"tags":"Added","source":{"book":"Monsters of the Multiverse","sourceType":"canon"},"featureDescription":"When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.

The faerie are callous and unchanging beings, so nothing sparks their fascination (and their envy) more than the malleable, bright spark of a young human child.\n\nA wechselkind is a construct crafted of wood, clay, and ceramic in the form of a small child, animated by faerie magic and concealed in a glamour that makes them appear identical to a stolen mortal babe. Once the glamour fades and the lie is revealed, the wechselkind is often cast out by its foster family, if not destroyed.\n\nOccasionally, though, a family takes pity on the poor creature and attempts to raise it as they would a child, only to find that while their mind develops normally, a wechselkind is forever bound in the unchanging form of a childlike doll.\n\nWhether nurtured or shunned, the wechselkind eventually finds itself an outcast in the world and must fend for itself as best it can. With few physical needs, the wechselkind often wanders from place to place, watching the people it encounters with envious eyes, hoping for a place to finally fit in.\n\nThe residual magic of its faerie glamour allows it to conceal itself in the guise of a human child, and a lone wechselkind often takes to begging by the side of the road or doing odd jobs around an isolated farmhouse, searching for some scraps of acceptance or a small trinket or two to take with it when it must inevitably move on.\n\nRecently, with the advent of the Weeping Pox, the wechselkind have started to emerge from hiding and be recognized as a separate species of creatures. With their immunity to disease, a number of wechselkind have offered their services as nurses and doctor’s assistants in plague-stricken regions, gaining recognition and praise from those able to see beyond their tragic beginnings. These wechselkind are grateful for a sense of purpose and a place to belong, but remain wary.
